   Not to be too snide about it, but I think this Christianity must
   be a very convenient religion, very maliable and suitable for
   any occassion since it seems one can take it any way one wants
   to go with it and follow whichever bits one pleases and
   reinterpret the bits that don't match with one's desires.  It
   is, in fact, so convenient that, were I capable of believing
   in a god, I might consider going for some brand of Christianity.
   The only difficulty left then, of course, is picking which sect
   to join.  There are just so many.
    
   Dean Kaflowitz

Yes, Christianity is convenient.  Following the teachings of Jesus
Christ and the Ten Commandments is convenient.  Trying to love in a
hateful world is convenient.  Turning the other cheek is convenient.  So
convenient that it is burdensome at times.

Dave.

And, you find the idea of a god more likely?

Besides, we can apply the anthropic principle to circumvent any

Psalm85(JPS): For the leader. Of the Korahites. A psalm. O LORD, You
will favor Your land, restore Jacob's fortune; You will forgive Your
people's iniquity, pardon all their sins; Selah; You will withdraw all Your
anger, turn away from Your rage. Turn again, O God, our helper, revoke
Your displeasure with us. Will you be angry with us forever, prolong
Your wrath for all generations? Surely You will revive us again, so that
Your people may rejoice in You. Show us, O LORD, Your faithfulness;
grant us Your deliverance. Let me hear what God, the LORD, will speak;
He will promise well-being to His people, His faithful ones; may they
not turn to folly. His help is very near those who fear Him, to make His
glory dwell in our land. Faithfulness and truth meet; justice and
well-being kiss. Truth springs up from the earth; justice looks down
from heaven. The LORD also bestows His bounty; our land yields its
produce. Justice goes before Him as He sets out on His way.

Too many clues, not enough substance.  You ask a lot of

be worried about, not me.  I'm not the inerrantist here.

Let me know when you are ready to get serious.

First of all as far as I know, only male homosexuality is explicitly
mentioned in the bibles, so you're off the hook there, I think. In
any event, there are *plenty* of people in many denominations who
do not consider a person's sexual identification of gay/lesbian/bisexual
as an "immoral lifestyle choice"

This is another misconception. You are not being told the whole story.

My former minister is a lesbian, and I know personally and
professionally several openly gay and lesbian ministers. I am
a Unitarian-Universalist and like most others in my denomination,
am pro-choice. You needn't go looking to the Unitarian Universalists
(which is a liberal religion) for acceptance of your sexual
identification and pro-choice views, however; there are many of us
who believe in spirituality AND freedom of conscience.

Good Luck on your journey!

Are you using Windows 3.0 or 3.1? If you're still on 3.0, 3.1 devotes about
twice as much memory to these and runs out much less frequently. If 3.1,
you might use one of the resource monitors (such as the one that comes with
the Windows 3.1 Resource Kit or one of the many shareware ones available)
to see which programs are hogging the resources (every icon, internal
graphics brush, etc. in every program running uses a certain amount of
this limited memory area. Also, some don't give it back when they're
finished).

	I found the MS defrag looks very much like Norton Speedisk.
Is it just a strip-down version of the later?

	I have both Norton Speedisk and Backup, so I was wondering 
if I need to install MS Backup?

0.  Xt Glossary
----------------------------------------------------------------------

o The Xt Intrinsics implement an object oriented interface to C code
  to allow useful graphical components to be created.  Included with
  this are classes that provide the base functionality: Object,
  RectObj, Core, Composite, Constraint, Shell, OverrideShell, WMShell,
  etc.  The terms "Xt" and "Intrinsics" are used interchangeably,
  however, they are used very precisely to mean a specific library of the X
  window system.  In particular, it does not include the Athena,
  Motif, OLIT or any other widget set.  Without further widgets the
  Intrinsics are not especially useful.

o A widget refers to a user interface abstraction created via Xt.  The
  precise use, is any object that is a subclass of the Core class.  It
  is used loosely to refer to anything that is a subclass of the
  Object class although these are more accurately called windowless
  widgets or gadgets.

o Xlib is the C interface to the X11 protocol.  It is one layer below
  the Xt Intrinsics.  Typically a widget uses relatively few Xlib
  functions because Xt provides most such services although an
  understanding of Xlib helps with problems.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
3.  Why does my application core dump when I use signals/alarms/cthreads?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

In brief, Xlib, Xt and most widget sets have no mutual exclusion for
critical sections.  Any interrupt handler is likely to leave one of
the above libraries in an inconsistent state -- such as all the
appropriate flags not yet set, dangling pointers, in the middle of a
list traversal, etc.  Note that the ANSI C standard points out that
behavior of a signal handler is undefined if the signal handler calls
any function other than signal() itself, so this is not a problem
specific to Xlib and Xt; the POSIX specification mentions other
functions which may be called safely but it may not be assumed that
these functions are called by Xlib or Xt functions.

The only safe way to deal with signals is to set a flag in the
interrupt handler.  This flag later needs to be checked either by a
work procedure or a timeout callback.  It is incorrect to add either
of these in the interrupt handler.  As another note, it is dangerous
to add a work procedure that never finishes.  This effectively
preempts any work procedures previously added and so they will never
be called.  Another option is to open a pipe, tell the event loop
about the read end using XtAppAddInput() and then the signal handler
can write a byte to the write end of the pipe for each signal.
However, this could deadlock your process if the pipe fills up.

Why don't the Intrinsics deal with this problem?  Primarily because it
is supposed to be a portable layer to any hardware and operating
system.   Is that a good enough reason -- I don't think so.

        Note: the article in The X Journal 1:4 and the example in O'Reilly
Volume 6 are in error.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
4.  How do I use a different visual than the default?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This requires a more complicated answer than it should.  A window has
three things that are visual specific -- the visual, colormap and
border pixmap.  All widgets have their own Colormap and BorderPixmap
resource; only shell widgets have Visual resources (another questions
deals with why shells have a Visual).  The default value of these
resources is CopyFromParent which does exactly what it says.  In the
shell widget CopyFromParent gets evalulated as DefaultVisualOfScreen
and DefaultColormapOfScreen.  When any one of the three resources is
not properly set, a BadMatch error occurs when the window is
created.  They are not properly set because each of the values depends
on the visual being used.  

How to get this to work?  There are two parts to the answer.  The
first is if you want an application to start with a particular visual
and the second is if you want a particular shell within an application
to start with a different visual.  The second is actually easier
because the basic information you need is available.  The first is a
little harder because you'll need to initialize much of the toolkit
yourself in order to determine the needed information.

/*
 * Some sample code to start up an application using something other
 * than the default visual.
 *
 * To compile:
 *	cc -g visual.c -o visual -lXaw -lXmu -lXt -lXext -lX11 -lm
 *
 * To run:
 *	./visual -geometry 300x300 -depth 24 -visual StaticColor -fg blue -bg yellow
 *
 * you need to move the mouse to get the particular visuals colormap
 * to install.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
5.  Which visual should an application use?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a point that can be argued about but one opinion is there is
no way for an application to know the appropriate visual -- it has to
be specified by the user.  If you disagree with this then your
application probably falls into the category of always using the
default visual or it is hardware specific and expects some particular
visual such as 24bit TrueColor with an OverlayPlane extension (or some
such).

Why?  No application runs in isolation.  Depending on the way a server
allocates resources I may not always want your application to run in
TrueColor mode if it is going to mess up my other applications.  I may
be very upset if it chooses to run in GreyScale instead of PsuedoColor
or just monochrome.

As an example, on a low end color Sun server there are many different
possible visuals: monochrome, 256 entry colormap, static gray, static
color, and a 3/3/2 TrueColor.  The SGI Iris's offer all the above 
plus 12 bit TrueColor, 24 bit TrueColor, an Overlay Plane.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
6.  Why do only Shell widgets have a Visual?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This is strictly by convention.  It makes it possible for an arbitrary
widget to know that the visual it uses can be found by looking for the
shell widget that is its ancestor and obtaining the visual of that
shell.

A widget can have its own visual resource.  If it does, it must have
its own realize method to use the visual when it calls
XCreateWindow().  You should also make this a resource that can be
obtained with XtGetValues() so other widgets can find it.  A
reasonable value is probably XtNvisual.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
7.  Which visual, depth and colormap do Shells inherit?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The default value for these resources are set to CopyFromParent.  This
is interpreted as the DefaultColormapOfScreen(), DefaultDepthOfScreen()
and the default visual of the screen if the widget has no parent -- i.e.
it is an applicationShellWidgetClass and the root of your widget tree.

If the parent of the widget is not null, then the shell copies
colormap and depth from its parent and uses CopyFromParent as the
visual.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
8.  I've done all the above and I still get a BadMatch error.  Why?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Some resource converters improperly cache references.  This was
especially true of X11R3 and earlier versions of Motif.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
9.  Why doesn't my widget get destroyed when I call XtDestroyWidget()?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

See section 2.8 of the Xt specification.

It eventually does get destroyed, just not immediately.  The
Intrinsics destroy a widget in a two-phase process.  First it and all
of its children have a flag set that indicate it is being destroyed.
It is then put on a list of widgets to be destroyed.  This way any
pending X events or further references to that widget can be cleaned
up before the memory is actually freed.  The second phase is then
performed after all callbacks, event handlers, and actions have
completed, before checking for the next X event.  At this point the
list is traversed and each widget's memory is actually free()'d, among
other things.

As some further caveats/trivia, the widgets may be destroyed if the
Intrinsics determine that they have no further references to the
widgets on the list.  If so, then the phase 2 destruction occurs
immediately.  Also, if nested event loops are used, widgets placed on
the destroy list before entering the inner event loop are not
destroyed until returning to the outer event loop.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
10. How do I exit but still execute the DestroyCallbacks?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The problem is if a simple and entirely reasonable approach to exiting
an application is used, such as calling exit() directly, then a widget
may not have a chance to clean up any external state -- such as open
sockets, temporary files, allocated X resources, etc.  (this code for
simplicity reasons assumes only a single toplevel widget):


	Widget
	ToplevelGet (gw)
		Widget		gw;		/* widget to find toplevel */
	{
		Widget		top;

		for (top = gw; XtParent (top); top = XtParent (top))
			/* empty */;
		return (top);
	}

	void
	ExitCallback (gw, closure, call_data)
		Widget		gw;		/* widget */
		XtPointer	closure;	/* data the app specified */
		XtPointer	call_data;	/* widget specific data */
	{
		Widget		toplevel;

		toplevel = ToplevelGet (gw);
		XtUnmapWidget (toplevel);	/* make it disappear quickly */
		XtDestroyWidget (toplevel);
		exit (0);
	}

One can see that the above code exit's immediately after destroying
the toplevel widget.  The trouble is the phase 2 destruction may never
occur.  

This works for most widgets and most applications but will not work
for those widgets that have any external state.  You might think that
since it works now it will always work but remember that part of the
reason an object oriented approach is used is so one can be ignorant
of the implementation details for each widget.  Which means that the
widget may change and someday require that some external state is
cleaned up by the Destroy callbacks.

One alternative is to modify ExitCallback() to set a global flag and
then test for that flag in a private event loop.  However, private
event loops are frowned upon because it tends to encourage sloppy, and
difficult to maintain practices.

Try the following code instead.

	#include <X11/Intrinsic.h>

	extern Widget ToplevelGet (
	#if NeedFunctionPrototypes
		Widget		gw
	#endif
	);

	extern Boolean ExitWorkProc (
	#if NeedFunctionPrototypes
		XtPointer	closure
	#endif
	);

	extern void ExitCallback (
	#if NeedFunctionPrototypes
		Widget		gw,
		XtPointer	closure,
		XtPointer	call_data
	#endif
	);

	Widget
	ToplevelGet (gw)
	Widget		gw;		/* widget to find toplevel */
	{
		Widget		top;

		for (top = gw; XtParent (top); top = XtParent (top))
			/* empty */;
		return (top);
	}


	void
	ExitCallback (gw, closure, call_data)
	Widget		gw;		/* widget */
	XtPointer	closure;	/* data the app specified */
	XtPointer	call_data;	/* widget specific data */
	{
		Widget		toplevel;

		toplevel = ToplevelGet (gw);
		XtUnmapWidget (toplevel);	/* make it disappear quickly */
		XtDestroyWidget (toplevel);
		XtAppAddWorkProc (XtWidgetToApplicationContext (gw),
				  ExitWorkProc, (XtPointer) NULL);
	}

	Boolean
	ExitWorkProc (closure)
		XtPointer	closure;
	{
		exit (0);
		/*NOTREACHED*/
	}


ExitCallback() adds a work procedure that will get called when the
application is next idle -- which happens after all the events are
processed and the destroy callbacks are executed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
11. How do I resize a Shell widget?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

After it is realized, one doesn't resize a Shell widget.  The proper
thing is to resize the currently managed child of the Shell widget
using XtSetValues().  The geometry change is then propagated to the
Shell which asks the window manager which may or may not allow the
request.  However, the Shell must have the resource
XtNallowShellResize set to True otherwise it will not even ask the
window manager to grant the request and the Shell will not resize.

To change the position of a Shell, use XtSetValues() on the Shell, not
the child, and within the limits of the window manager it should be granted.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
12. Why can't XtAppAddInput() handle files?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

It does, however Unix semantics for when I/O is ready for a file does
not fit most peoples' intuitive model.  In Unix terms a file
descriptor is ready for reading whenever the read() call would not
block, ignoring the setting of optional flags that indicate not to
block.  This works as expected for terminals, sockets and pipes.  For
a file the read() will always return but the return indicates an EOF
-- i.e. no more data.  The result is the code in the Intrinsics always
calls the input handler because it always thinks something is about to
be read.  The culprit is the select() system call or on SYSV based
OS's it is the poll() system call.

How to get around this on a Unix system?  The best approach is to use
another process to check for available input on the file.  Use a pipe
to connect the application with this other process and pass the file
descriptor from the pipe to XtAppAddInput().  A suitable program on
BSD systems is "tail -f filename".

It's rumored that select() on some systems is not _completely_
reliable.  In particular:

	- IBM AIX 3.1: this is one where it would work for a while
	  (several thousand times) and then stop until some other
	  event woke it up. This seemed to be the result of a race
	  condition in the Kernel.  IBM claims to have a fix for this.

	- Pyramid, doesn't work at all.

	- Ultrix (and possibly others where pipes are implemented as
	  sockets), wasn't completely broken, but although the writing
	  side wrote in 512 byte blocks the reading side received it
	  all broken up as if it was being put into the pipe a byte at
	  a time.  You can waste a lot of time by reading small blocks
	  (get raound it by detecting the situation and having
	  select() ignore the pipe for 10 mseconds - by then it had
	  been given the whole block).


Note that all the above descriptions used Unix terminology such as
read(), file descriptor, pipes, etc.  This is an OS dependent area and
may not be identical on all systems.  However the Intrinsic designers
felt it was a common enough operation that it should be included with
part of the toolkit.  Why they didn't also deal with signals at this
point I don't know.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
13. What good books and magazines are there on Xt?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

I have a favorite that is the definitive reference.  To my perspective
it offers a reasonable introduction but also goes into the full
details of the Intrinsics.  When I started using it I was already
familiar with Xt and the concepts behind it, so newcomers may or may
not find it useful.  I've always found it accurate and complete, which
means its a 1000 pages.

Asente, Paul J., and Swick, Ralph R., "X Window System Toolkit, The
	Complete Programmer's Guide and Specification", Digital Press,
	1990, ISBN 1-55558-051-3, order number EY-E757E-DP; and by
	Prentice-Hall, ISBN 0-13-972191-6. Also available through DEC
	Direct at 1-800-DIGITAL.

The other book I commonly recomend to novices is:

Young, Doug. "The X Window System: Applications and Programming with
	Xt (Motif Version)," Prentice Hall, 1989 (ISBN 0-13-497074-8).
	(ISBN 0-13-972167-3)

And of course O'Reilly has an entire series of manuals on X and Xt.
O'Reilly ordering is 800-998-9938.  In particular, Volume 5 is an Xt
reference done in manual page style.  The 3rd edition is extensively
overhauled and goes far beyond the MIT manual pages.  I'm finding it
very useful.  In particular, the permutted index and references to
other manual pages help a great deal in chasing down related
information.

I read two periodicals, "The X Resource" and the "The X Journal".
These are the only two dealing specifically with X.  "The X Resource"
is published quarterly, by O'Reilly, with one of the issues being the
MIT X Consortium Technical Conference Proceedings.  There is no
advertising.  I've found it informative with pretty good depth.  For
orders, call 1-800-998-9938, or email cathyr@ora.com.  For editorial
matters, email adrian@ora.com.  Table of contents are posted at
math.utah.edu in ~ftp/pub/tex/bib in TeX form and on ftp.uu.net in
~ftp/published/oreilly/xresource in ASCII form.


"The X Journal" is a bimonthly trade rag with lots of advertising.
The articles are informative and oriented toward a less technical
audience.  I read it more to see what's going on then with an
expectation of learning a great deal (but remember, I represent a
fairly small percentage of people).  Also, they have a pretty good
collection of people on the advisory board and as columnists.  Call
(908) 563-9033.

14. What Widgets are available?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

There are three popular widget sets:

Athena	- The set provided with X11.  This is sufficient for most
	  purposes but is on the ugly side.  Recently, a 3d look is
	  available for ftp on export.lcs.mit.edu:/contrib/Xaw3d.tar.Z.
Motif	- From OSF available for a license fee and commonly shipped on
	  many workstation vendors platforms (almost everyone but
	  Sun).  It looks good and works well but personally I think
	  it is poorly implemented.
OLIT	- The Open Look Intrinsics Toolkit is a set of widgets
	  implementing Sun's Open Look specification.  Developed by
	  AT&T.  I've never used it so can't comment on its quality.
	  I've heard rumours that it is a pain to actually get.

In addition the following collection of widgets are also available:

Xtra	- a library of widgets for sale from Graphical Software
	  Technology (310-328-9338).  It includes bar graph, stacked
	  bar graph, line graph, pie chart, xy plot, hypertext, help,
	  spreadsheet, and data entry form widgets.  I've never seen
	  them so I can't comment.
FWF	- The Free Widget Foundation is attempting to collect a set of
	  freely available widgets.  Included are a Pixmap editor,
	  FileDialog, and a few others.  The current set of widgets
	  can be obtained via anonymous ftp from the machine
	  a.cs.uiuc.edu (128.174.252.1) in the file pub/fwf.shar.Z.
Xcu	- The Cornell University widgets from Gene Dykes.  One of the
	  early widget sets released.  Provides a nice appearance for
	  buttons and has a mini command language.  Probably not so
	  widely used.
Xs	- The Sony widget set.  This was around during R3 days but
	  seemed to disappear.  It looked like it had promise.
Xw	- The HP widgets.  The precursor to Motif.  Originally written
	  for R3 there exists diffs to get it to work under R4 & R5.
	  Again, a pretty good widget set but has more or less died.
	  The precursor to this was the Xray toolkit which was
	  originally implemented for X10R4 and apparently provided
	  much experience for the designers of Xt.
Xo	- A widget set I'm working on.  It's still primitive but you
	  can give it a try in archive.cis.ohio-state.edu:pub/Xo/*

The following specialized widgets are also available:

Tbl	- Implements a tabular layout of widgets.  Supports Motif
	  widgets as children.  Part of Wcl.
Plots	- The Athena Plotting widgets (not the Athena widgets).
	  Contact gnb@bby.oz.au or joe@Athena.MIT.EDU.

15. What alternatives to the Intrinsics are there?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

	__________________________________________
	Name		Language	Vendor
	__________________________________________
	Xview		C		Sun
	OI		C++		ParcPlace
	Interviews	C++		Stanford
	Tcl/tk		C		sprite.berkeley.edu
	__________________________________________


However much I like C and admire the skill in both designing and
implementing the Intrinsics, hopefully some alternative will develop
in the next 3-5 years that uses an object oriented language.  Keep
your eyes open and expect some change about the same time a language
other than C _starts_ gaining acceptance.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
16. How do I pass a float value to XtSetValues?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

First, what is going wrong is the structure for an Arg is (essentially)
	typdef struct
	{	
	    String	name;
	    long	value;
	} Arg;

and the code:
	Arg	arg;

	XtSetArg (arg, "name", 3.2)

expands to
	Arg	arg;

	arg.name = "name";
	arg.value = 3.2;

you can see that with normal C type conversions, the arg.value
gets the integer "3" instead of the floating point value "3.2".  When
the value is copied into the widget resource, the bit pattern is
wildly different than that required for a floating point value.  So,
how to get around this?

The following macro is from the Athena widgets document and I am now
recomending it over the previous suggestions.

#define XtSetFloatArg(arg, n, d) \
    if (sizeof(float) > sizeof(XtArgVal)) { \
        XtSetArg(arg, n, &(d)); \
    } else { \
        XtArgVal *ld = (XtArgVal *)&(d); \
        XtSetArg(arg, n, *ld); \
    }


----------------------------------------------------------------------
17. How do I write a resource converter?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Courtesy of Rich Thomson (rthomson@dsd.es.com):

The following discussion of resource converters assumes R4 (or R5)
Intrinsics.  Resource converters changed between R3 and R4 to allow
for destructors and caching of converted values.

There are several main types of resource converters:

    string to data type
    data type to string
    data type to data type

i) string to data type
    Usually a string to data type converter has a fixed set of strings
    that will be converted to data type values.  This is most often
    used to map enumerated names to enumerated values:

	Name		Value
	"True"		1
	"False"		0

    In this case, the string to data type converter needs to compare
    the resource value to the list of fixed strings.  This is most
    readily accomplished by the use of the "quark" mechanism of the
    resource manager.  The resource value is turned into a quark,
    which is a unique representation of the string that fits into a
    single word.  Then the resource quark is compared against the
    quarks for the fixed strings representing the enumerated values.

    If there are many enumerated strings in the converter (or many
    converters, each with a small number of enumeration strings), then
    a global initialization routine might be used to turn all the
    resource strings into quarks.  That way, the first time one of
    these converters is used, the strings will be turned into quarks
    and held in static variables for use in the next invocation of one
    of the converters.

ii) data type to string
    This type of converter is slightly easier than the string to data
    type converters since the use of quarks isn't necessary.  Instead,
    the data type value is simply converted to a string value,
    probably by the use of sprintf.

    Data type to string converters are useful for applications that
    wish to convert an internal data type value into a string so that
    they can write out a valid resource specification to a file.  This
    mechanism can be used to provide a "snapshot" of application state
    into a file.  This snapshot can be used to restore the program to
    a known state via the usual X resource database mechanisms.

    If you are taking the trouble to write a string to data type
    converter, it isn't much extra effort to write the data type to
    string converter.  Writing both at the same time helps to ensure
    that they are consistent.

iii) data type to data type
    This type of converter is used to convert an existing data type
    value to another data type.  For instance, an X pixel value can be
    converted to an RGB data type that contains separate fields for
    red, green and blue.


The type signature for a resource converter is as follows:

typedef Boolean (*XtTypeConverter)(Display *, XrmValuePtr, Cardinal *,
	XrmValuePtr, XrmValuePtr, XtPointer *);
    Display *dpy;
    XrmValuePtr args;
    Cardinal *num_args;
    XrmValuePtr fromVal;
    XrmValuePtr toVal;
    XtPointer *converter_data;

When the converter is invoked, the "fromVal" argument points to the source
X resource manager value and the "toVal" argument points to the
destination X resource manager value.  The "converter_data" argument
is an opaque pointer to some converter-specific data that is specified
when the converter is registered.  The "args" and "num_args" arguments
allow extra information to be passed to the converter when it is
invoked.  For instance, the Pixel to RGB structure converter discussed
above would need colormap and visual arguments in which to lookup the
Pixel to obtain the RGB values corresponding to that pixel.

Care must be taken with the "toVal" argument.  An XrmValue has the
following type definition and specifies a size and location for a
converted value:

typedef struct {
    unsigned int    size;
    caddr_t         addr;
} XrmValue, *XrmValuePtr;

When the converter is invoked, the address may point to a location of
the given size for the converted value or the location can be NULL.
In the former case, the converter should ensure that the size of the
destination area is large enough to handle the converted value.  If
the destination area is not large enough, then the converter should
set the size to the amount of space needed and return False.  The
caller can then ensure that enough space is allocated and reinvoke the
converter.  If the size is large enough, then the converter can simply
copy the converted value into the space given and return True.

If the location is NULL, then the converter can assign the location to
the address of a static variable containing the converted value and
return True.

When writing a group of converters, this code is often repeated and it
becomes convenient to define a macro:

    #define DONE(var, type) \
      if (toVal->addr) \
	{ \
	  if (toVal->size < sizeof(type)) \
	    { \
	      toVal->size = sizeof(type); \
	      return False; \
	    } \
	  else \
	    *((type *) toVal->addr) = var; \
	} \
      else \
	toVal->addr = (caddr_t) &var; \
      toVal->size = sizeof(type); \
      return True;

    #define DONESTR(str) \
      if (toVal->addr && toVal->size < sizeof(String)) \
	{ \
	  toVal->size = sizeof(String); \
	  return False; \
	} \
      else \
	toVal->addr = (caddr_t) str; \
      toVal->size = sizeof(String); \
      return True;

Inside the converter, it is a good idea to perform a little safety
checking on the "num_args" and "args" arguments to ensure that your
converter is being called properly.

Once you have written your converter, you need to register it with the
Intrinsics.  The Intrinsics invokes resource converters when creating
widgets and fetching their resource values from the resource database.

To register a converter with a single application context, use
XtAppSetTypeConverter:

void XtAppSetTypeConverter(context, from, to, converter, args, num_args,
	cache, destructor)
    XtAppContext context;
    String from;
    String to;
    XtTypeConverter converter;
    XtConvertArgList args;
    Cardinal num_args;
    XtCacheType cache;
    XtDestructor destructor;

To register a converter with all application contexts, use
XtSetTypeConverter:

void XtSetTypeConverter(from, to, converter, args, num_args,
	cache, destructor)
    String from;
    String to;
    XtTypeConverter converter;
    XtConvertArgList args;
    Cardinal num_args;
    XtCacheType cache;
    XtDestructor destructor;

In the R3 Intrinsics, there were the routines XtAppAddConverter and
XtAddConverter; these have been superseded by XtAppSetTypeConverter
and XtSetTypeConverter.  Whenever possible, the newer routines should be
used.

When a converter is registered with the Intrinsics, a "cache" argument
specifies how converted resource values are to be cached:

    XtCacheNone		Don't cache any converted values
    XtCacheAll		Cache all converted values
    XtCacheByDisplay	Cache converted values on a per display basis

Caching converted values that require a round-trip to the server is a
good idea (for instance string to Pixel conversions).

The "destructor" argument is a routine that is invoked then the
resource is destroyed, either because its cached reference count has
been decremented to zero or because the widget owning the value is
being destroyed.  XtDestructor has the following type definition:

typedef void (*XtDestructor)(XtAppContext, XrmValuePtr, XtPointer,
	XrmValuePtr, Cardinal *);
    XtAppContext context;
    XrmValuePtr to;
    XtPointer converter_data;
    XrmValuePtr args;
    Cardinal *num_args;

The destructor is invoked to free any auxiliary storage associated
with the "to" argument, but does not actually free the storage pointed
to by the "to" argument itself (to->addr).  The destructor is passed
the extra arguments that were passed to the converter when the
conversion was performed (for instance, colormap and visual arguments
for the string to Pixel converter since the destructor would need to
free the allocated Pixel from the colormap) as well as the private
data passed in when the converter was registered.

Sample converter code can be found in the following files in the MIT
R5 distribution:

    mit/lib/Xt/Converters.c
    contrib/lib/PEXt/Converters.c
    contrib/lib/PEXt/Converters.h

18. How do I open multiple displays?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

See "Multi-user Application Software Using Xt", The X Resource, Issue 3,
(Summer 1992) by Oliver Jones for a complete coverage of the issues
involved.  Most of this answer is based on that article.  In a
nutshell, one uses XtOpenDisplay() to add each display to a _single_
application context and then XtCloseDisplay() to shutdown each display
and remove it from the application context.

The real problems occur when trying to close down a display.  This can
happen 3 ways:
	1. User selects a "quit" button on one of the displays,
	2. User has window manager send a WM_DELETE_WINDOW message,
	3. Server disconnect -- possibly from a KillClient message,
	   server shutdown/crash, or network failure.

I'll assume you can deal gracefully with 1 & 2 since it is _merely_ a
problem of translating a Widget to a display and removing that
display.  If not, then read the Oliver Jones article.

The third one is difficult to handle.  The following is based on the
Oliver Jones article and I include it here because it is a difficult
problem.

The difficulty arises because the Xlib design presumed that an I/O
error is always unrecoverable and so fatal.  This is essentially true
for a single display X based application, but not true for a
multiple display program or an application that does things other than
display information on an X server.  When an X I/O error occurs the
I/O error handler is called and _if_ it returns then an exit()
happens.  The only way around this is to use setjmp/longjmp to avoid
returning to the I/O error handler.  The following code fragment
demonstrates this:

#include <setjmp.h>
jmp_buf XIOrecover;

void
XIOHandler (dpy)
	Display		*dpy;
{
	destroyDisplay (dpy);
	longjmp (XIOrecover, 1);
}

main ()
{
	...
	if (setjmp (XIOrecover) == 0)
		XSetIOErrorHandler (XIOHandler);
	XtAppMainLoop (app_context);
}

The destroyDisplay() is something that given a Display pointer can go
back to the application specific data and perform any necessary
cleanup.  It should also call XtCloseDisplay().

For those of you unfamiliar with setjmp/longjmp, when setjmp() is
first called it returns a 0 and save's enough information in the
jmp_buf that a latter execution of longjmp() can return the program to
the same state as if the setjmp() was just executed.  The return value
of this second setjmp() is the value of the second argument to
longjmp().  There are several caveats about using these but for this
purpose it is adequate.

Some other problems you might run into are resource converters that
improperly cache resources.  The most likely symptoms are Xlib errors
such as BadColor, BadAtom, or BadFont.  There may be problems with the
total number of displays you can open since typically only a limited
number of file descriptors are available with 32 being a typical
value.  You may also run into authorization problems when trying to
connect to a display.

There was much discussion in comp.windows.x about this topic in
November of 91.  Robert Scheifler posted an article which basically
said this is the way it will be and Xlib will not change.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
19. What changed from R3 to R4 to R5?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This addresses only changes in the Intrinsics.  First, the general
changes for each release are described.  Then a, certainly incomplete,
list of new functions added and others that are now deprecated are
listed.  Brevity is a primary goal.

Much of the following information is retrieved from Chapter 13 of the MIT
Xt Intrinsics Manual and from O'Reilly Volume 5, 3rd edition.

From R3 to R4
- Addition of gadgets (windowless widgets)
- New resource type converter interface to handle cacheing and
  additional  data.
- Variable argument list interface.
- #define XtSpecificationRelease 4  (added with this release)
- WMShellPart, TopLevelShellPart & TransientShellPart changed
  incompatibly.
- core.initialize, core.set_values added ArgList and count parameters

  "Xt Performance Improvements in Release 5" by Gabe Beged-Dov in "The
  X Resource", Issue 3):
	- XrmStringToQuark() augmented with XrmPermStringToQuark() to
	  avoid string copies.  Several fields in the class record are
	  indicated as needing permanent strings.
	- Using an array of Strings for resources
	- Callback lists redesigned to use less memory
	- Translation manager redesigned and rewritten so it takes
	  less memory, translation tables merges are faster, cache of
	  action bindings
	- Keycode to Keysyms are cached.
	- Better sharing of GC's with modifiable fields
	- Window to Widget translation uses less space and faster
	- Does not malloc space for widget name since quark is available
	- Widget space is allocated to include the constraints
	- Over several example programs, about a 26% reduction in
	  memory usage.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
20. Where are the resources loaded from?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The resources of a widget are filled in from the following places
(from highest priority to lowest priority):

	1. Args passed at creation time.
	2. Command line arguments.
	3. User's per host defaults file
	4. User's defaults file.
	5. User's per application default file.
	6. System wide per application default file.

Note that 2-6 are read only once on application startup.  The result
of steps 3-6 is a single resource database used for further queries.

The per host defaults file contains customizations for all
applications executing on a specific computer.  This file is either
specified with the XENVIRONMENT environment variable or if that is not
set then the file $HOME/.Xdefaults-<host> is used.

The user defaults file is either obtained from the RESOURCE_MANAGER
property on the root window of the display or if that is not set then
the file $HOME/.Xdefaults is used.  Typically, the program "xrdb" is
used to set the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.  Please note that this
should be kept relatively small as each client that connects to the
display must transfer the property.  A size of around 1-3KByte is
reasonable.  Some toolkits may track changes to the RESOURCE_MANAGER
but most do not.

A user may have many per application default files containing
customizations specific to each application.  The intrinsics are quite
flexible on how this file is found.  Read the next part that describes
the various environment variables and how they effect where this file
is found.

The system wide per application default files are typically found in
/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults.  If such a file is not found then the
fallback resources are used.  The intrinsics are quite flexible on how
this file is found.  Read the next part that describes the various
environment variables and how they effect where this file is found.

[Thanks to Oliver Jones (oj@pictel.com) for the following, 6/92]

You can use several environment variables to control how resources are
loaded for your Xt-based programs -- XFILESEARCHPATH,
XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, and XAPPLRESDIR.  These environment variables
control where Xt looks for application-defaults files as an
application is initializing.  Xt loads at most one app-defaults file
from the path defined in XFILESEARCHPATH and another from the path
defined in XUSERFILESEARCHPATH.

Set XFILESEARCHPATH if software is installed on your system in such a
way that app-defaults files appear in several different directory
hierarchies.  Suppose, for example, that you are running Sun's Open
Windows, and you also have some R4 X applications installed in
/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults. You could set a value like this for
XFILESEARCHPATH, and it would cause Xt to look up app-defaults files
in both /usr/lib/X11 and /usr/openwin/lib (or wherever your
OPENWINHOME is located):

	setenv XFILESEARCHPATH /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N:$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N

The value of this environment variable is a colon-separated list of
pathnames.  The pathnames contain replacement characters as follows
(see XtResolvePathname()):

	%N	The value of the filename parameter, or the
		application's class name.
	%T	The value of the file "type".  In this case, the
		literal string "app-defaults"
	%C	customization resource (R5 only)
	%S	Suffix.  None for app-defaults.
	%L	Language, locale, and codeset (e.g. "ja_JP.EUC")
	%l	Language part of %L  (e.g. "ja")
	%t	The territory part of the display's language string
	%c	The codeset part of the display's language string

Let's take apart the example.  Suppose the application's class name is
"Myterm". Also, suppose Open Windows is installed in /usr/openwin.
(Notice the example omits locale-specific lookup.)

	/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N        means /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm
	$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N    means /usr/openwin/lib/app-defaults/Myterm

As the application initializes, Xt tries to open both of the above
app-defaults files, in the order shown.  As soon as it finds one, it
reads it and uses it, and stops looking for others.  The effect of
this path is to search first in /usr/lib/X11, then in /usr/openwin.

Let's consider another example. This time, let's set
XUSERFILESEARCHPATH so it looks for the file Myterm.ad in the current
working directory, then for Myterm in the directory ~/app-defaults.

	setenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH ./%N.ad:$HOME/app-defaults/%N

The first path in the list expands to ./Myterm.ad.  The second expands
to $HOME/app-defaults/Myterm.  This is a convenient setting for
debugging because it follows the Imake convention of naming the
app-defaults file Myterm.ad in the application's source directory, so
you can run the application from the directory in which you are
working and still have the resources loaded properly.

NOTE: when looking for app-default files with XUSERFILESEARCHPATH,
      for some  bizarre reason, neither the type nor file suffix is
      defined so %T and %S are useless.

With R5, there's another twist.  You may specify a customization
resource value.  For example, you might run the "myterm" application
like this:

	myterm -xrm "*customization: -color"

If one of your pathname specifications had the value
"/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/%N%C" then the expanded pathname would be
"/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm-color" because the %C substitution
character takes on the value of the customization resource.

The default XFILESEARCHPATH, compiled into Xt, is:

		/usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N%C:\  (R5)
		/usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N%C:\  (R5)
		/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%C:\     (R5)
		/usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N:\
		/usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N:\
		/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N

(Note: some sites replace /usr/lib/X11 with a ProjectRoot in this
batch of default settings.)

The default XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, also compiled into Xt, is 

		<root>/%L/%N%C:\  (R5)
		<root>/%l/%N%C:\  (R5)
		<root>/%N%C:\     (R5)
		<root>/%L/%N:\
		<root>/%l/%N:\
		<root>/%N:

<root> is either the value of XAPPLRESDIR or the user's home directory
if XAPPLRESDIR is not set.  If you set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to some
value other than the default, Xt ignores XAPPLRESDIR altogether.

Notice that the quick and dirty way of making your application find
your app-defaults file in your current working directory is to set
XAPPLRESDIR to ".", a single dot.  In R3, all this machinery worked
differently; for R3 compatibilty, many people set their XAPPLRESDIR
value to "./", a dot followed by a slash.

21. What order are callbacks executed in?
----------------------------------------------------------------------
(Courtesy of Donna Converse, converse@expo.lcs.mit.edu; 5/10/92)

The Intrinsics library do not guarantee an order.  This is because
both the widget writer and the application writer have the ability to
modify the entire contents of the callback list.  Neither one
currently knows what the other is doing and so the Intrinsics cannot
guarantee the order of execution.

The application programmer cannot rely on the widget writer; the
widget writer is not required to document when the widget will add and
remove callbacks from the list or what effect this will have;
therefore the functionality contained in a callback should be
independent of the functionality contained in other callbacks on the
list.

Even though the Xt standard in the definition of XtAddCallback
says:

 	"callback_name: Specifies the callback list to which the
 	procedure is to be appended."
 
you may not infer from the word "appended" that the callback routines
are called in the same order as they have been added to the callback
list.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
22. How do I know if a widget is visible?
----------------------------------------------------------------------
(Courtesy of Donna Converse, converse@expo.lcs.mit.edu; 5/14/92)

> I am building a widget needs to know if it is visible. I set the visible
> interest field in Core and if my window is completely obscured, the Core

> stays set to TRUE.

Right, everything is implemented correctly.  This demonstrates a "deficiency"
in the X protocol, and the Core widget is reflecting the capabilities of the
protocol.  (The "deficiency" is that the information is available in one way,
in this case an inconvenient way.)  The Xt specification is accurate, in
the second and third paragraphs of section 7.10.2, so read this section
carefully.  The visible field will not change in response to iconification.

A VisibilityNotify event will not be received when the window goes from
viewable to unviewable, that is, when the widget or an ancestor is unmapped;
that is, when iconification occurs.  This is the protocol deficiency.
Visibility state and viewable state have specific meanings in the X protocol;
see the glossary in your Xlib and X protocol reference manual.

> Is this a problem with "mwm" or is there something
> else which needs to be done?

You'll see this with any window manager, with no window manager.

> If the problem is "mwm", what is the fastest
> way to determine if a window is iconified? 

As an application writer, keep track with a global Boolean in an action
routine with translations for MapNotify and UnmapNotify on the Shell widget
which contains your custom widget.  As the custom widget writer, see the
map_state field returned by a call to XGetWindowAttributes.  These are
suggestions.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
23. How do I reparent a widget in Xt, i.e. XtReparentWidget()?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

You can't.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
24. Why use XtMalloc, XtFree, etc?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Unfortunately, most code that calls malloc(), realloc() or calloc()
tends to ignore the possibility of returning NULL.  At best it is
handled something like:

	ptr = (type *) malloc (sizeof (type))
	if (!ptr)
	{
		perror ("malloc in xyzzy()");
		exit (1)
	}
To handle this common case the Intrinsics define the functions
XtMalloc(), XtCalloc(), XtNew(), XtNewString() and XtRealloc() which
all use the standard C language functions malloc(), calloc() and
realloc() but execute XtErrorMsg() if a NULL value is returned.  Xt
error handlers are not supposed to return so this effectively exits.

In addition, if XtRealloc() is called with a NULL pointer, it uses
XtMalloc() to get the initial space.  This allows code like:

	if (!ptr)
		ptr = (type *) malloc (sizeof (type));
	else
		ptr = (type *) realloc (ptr, sizeof (type) * (count + 1));
	++count;

to be written as:

	ptr = XtRealloc (ptr, sizeof (ptr) * ++count);

Also, XtFree() accepts a NULL pointer as an argument.  Generally, I've
found the Xt functions conveniant to use.  However, anytime I'm
allocating anything potentially large I use the standard functions so
I can fully recover from not enough memory errors.

XtNew() and XtNewString() are conveniant macros for allocating a
structure or copying a string:

	  struct abc *xyzzy;
	  char	     *ptr;
	  char	     *str = "abcdef";

	  xyzzy = XtNew (struct abc);	/* takes care of type casting */
	  ptr = XtNewString (str);

A strict interpretation of the Intrinsics reference manual allow an
implementation to provide functions that are not exchangable with
malloc() and free().  I.e. code such as:

	 char	      *ptr;

	 ptr = XtMalloc (100);
	 /* ... */
	 free (ptr);

may not work.  Personally, I'd call any implementation that did this
broken and complain to the vendor.

A common error for Motif programmers is to use XtFree() on a string
when they should really be using XmStringFree().

----------------------------------------------------------------------
25. How to debug an Xt application?
----------------------------------------------------------------------
First, I'd recomend getting "purify" from Pure Software.  This is a
great package for tracing memory problems on Sun's.  It's a bit pricey
at $2750 but I'd still recomend it.  Excuse the marketing blurb
(contact support@pure.com for more info).

	Purify inserts additional checking instructions directly into
	the object code produced by existing compilers.  These
	instructions check every memory read and write performed by
	the program under test and detect several types of access
	errors, such as reading unitialized memory, writing past
	malloc'd bounds, or writing to freed memory.  Purify inserts
	checking logic into all of the code in a program, including
	third party and vendor object-code libraries, and verifies
	system call interfaces.  In addition, Purify tracks memory
	usage and identifies individual memory leaks using a novel
	adaption of garbage collection techniques.  Purify's nearly
	comprehensive memory access checking slows the target program
	down typically by a factor of two to five.

An alternative package that isn't as pricey ($395 for a Sun), runs on
many Unix's and has pretty similar features is "The SENTINEL Debugging
Environment".  This replaces malloc() and several other C library
functions to add additional checks.  (contact cpcahil@virtech.vti.com
for more info)

Next, if you are getting any sort of Xlib error, you'll need to run in
synchronous mode, easily accomplished with the "-sync" command line
argument or by setting the variable Xdebug to 1 with your debugger.  Then
set a break point in exit().  This will let you trace back to the
original Xlib function being called.  If you don't run in synchronous
mode, then the actual error may have occured any number of calls to
Xlib previously since the Xlib calls are buffered and replies from the
server are asynchronous.

Next, if you are having trouble with window layout, you can use the
undocumented resource "xtIdentifyWindows" or the class resource
"XtDebug" to cause the widget name to be identified with each window.
For example:

    example% xload -xrm '*XtDebug:true' &
    example% xwininfo -tree
	     <click in new xload window>

will give the normal information but the widget name and class of each
window is included.  This can help for checking the location and size
of errant widgets.

Next, if you are having trouble with geometry managers or you want to
test the way a widget manages it's children, you can try
export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/libXtGeo.tar.Z.  This acts as a filter
between any children and a geometry manager and checks the behaviour
of both.  It's a very clever idea.

The most unfortunate problem is debugging a callback while the
application is executing a grab of the keyboard or mouse (such as from
a pulldown menu).  The server effectively locks up and you'll need to
go to another machine and kill the debugger manually.  The server
locks up because the application being debugged has said no one else
can have access to the keyboard but the application is not stopped
waiting because the debugger is waiting for your commands.
Unfortunately you can't give them because all the input is going to
your application which is stopped.

The best way to debug this kind of problem is with two machines on
your desk, running the program under a debugger (or other environment)
on one machine, and running the application on the other, possibly
using a command sequence like this:

	othermachine% xhost +thismachine
	thismachine% setenv DISPLAY othermachine:0;
	thismachine% gdb application	# Your favorite debugger.
	or this:
	othermachine% xhost +thismachine
	thismachine% gdb application
	(gdb) set environment DISPLAY othermachine:0
	(gdb) run ...

I believe CodeCenter, a C interpreter/graphical debugger has a method
of dealing with this by explicitely calling the Xlib functions to
release any grabs during breakpoints.

Debugging widget problems requires pretty good debugging skills and
knowledge of how widgets work.  You can go a long way without knowing
the internals of a particular widget but not very far without
understanding how a widget works.  Judicious use of conditional
breakpoints and adding print statements with the debugger help a great
deal.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
26. Why don't XtAddInput(), XtAddTimeout() and XtAddWorkProc() work?
----------------------------------------------------------------------
   I have got a delicate problem with the three routines XtAddInput,
   XtAddTimeOut and XtAddWorkProc. The problem I have is that when
   I use them in my application they seem not to be registred properly.
   I have made a handy little testprogram where everything works
   perfect, but in my "real" application nothing happens. 

The introduction in R3 of the XtApp*() functions obsoleted those
routines (see Q19 for other changes in R3, R4, and R5).  What happens is
they use a default application context different then the one you may
have created.  Since events and timeouts are distributed on a per
application context basis and you are using two application contexts,
you won't get those events.

For example:

	...
	cnt = 0;
	toplevel = XtAppInitialize(&app, class,
				   Desc, XtNumber (Desc),
				   &argc, argv,
				   Fallback, args, cnt);

	XtAddTimeOut (...)
	XtAddWorkProc (...)

	XtAppMainLoop (app)

would never invoke the timeout.

27. What is and how can I implement drag and drop?
----------------------------------------------------------------------
(Courtesy of Roger Reynolds, rogerr@netcom.com; 19 Feb 93)

Drag-n-drop is a buzzword for moving data between clients, in an
``intuitive'' fashion.

Motif Version 1.2 supports drag-n-drop capabilities, OpenLook has
supported d-n-d all along.  The two protocols are not compatable with
each other, and so far as I know, they are not published.

I wrote a package called RDD which is designed to be a flexible public
protocol for doing drag 'n drop operations between clients.  My
intention was to provide a tool which would make it easy for people to
support a "standard" drag-n-drop protocol in the programs they develop
and contribute or sell, regardless of what widget set is used (as long
as it is based on Xt).

The implementation is based upon my understanding of the ICCCM
conventions, for more details read the code.

I have heard from dozens of people using RDD who like it and feel that
it works a whole lot better than Motif 1.2 stuff.  Also, there seem to
be many who think that it is neat but are constrained to use Motif
anyway.

The latest RDD (and some other stuff) is available for ftp from
netcom.com, in /pub/rogerr.  A (possibly older) version is also
available on export.lcs.mit.edu in /contrib.

Frequently Asked Questions About X on Intel-based Unix (with answers)
=====================================================================

I) What options do I have for X software on my Intel-based Unix system?

1. Free options
	The BEST option is XFree86, which is an enhanced version of X386 1.2.
	Any other version of X386 will have slower performance, and will
	be more difficult to compile.  Information on how to obtain XFree86
	is listed below.

	X386 is the port of the X11 server to System V/386 that was
	done by Thomas Roell (roell@sgcs.com).
	It supports a wide variety of SVGA boards.
	There are 2 major free versions: X386 1.1 is based on X11R4,
	X386 1.2 is included in MIT's X11R5 distribution (ie. you
	don't need to patch it into the MIT source any more).
	X386 1.3 is the current commercial offering from SGCS (see below).

II) What is XFree86 and where do I get it?

3. What is XFree86?

   XFree86 is an enhanced version of X386 1.2, which was distributed with
   X11R5.  This release consists of many bug fixes, speed improvements, and
   other enhancements.  Here are the highlights of the enhancements:

    1) The SpeedUp package from Glenn Lai is an integral part of XFree86,
       selectable at run-time via the Xconfig file.  Some SpeedUps require
       an ET4000 based SVGA, and others require a virtual screen width of
       1024.  The SpeedUps suitable to the configuration are selected by
       default.  With a high-quality ET4000 board (VRAM), this can yield
       up to 40% improvement of the xStones benchmark over X386 1.2.
    2) The fX386 packages from Jim Tsillas are included as the default
       operating mode if SpeedUp is not selected.  This mode is now
       equivalent in performance to X386 1.1b (X11R4), and approximately
       20% faster than X386 1.2.
    3) Support for LOCALCONN, compile-time selectable for server, clients,
       or both.  This support is for both SVR3.2 and SVR4.  For SVR4.0.4
       with the 'Advanced Compatibility Package', local connections from
       SCO XSight/ODT clients are supported.
    4) Drivers for ATI and Trident TVGA8900C and TVGA9000 SVGA chipsets.
       Refer to the files README.ati and README.trident for details about
       the ATI and Trident drivers.
    5) Support for compressed bitmap fonts has been added (Thomas Eberhardt's
       code from the contrib directory on export.lcs.mit.edu).
    6) Type1 Font code from MIT contrib tape has been included, and is
       compile-time selectable.  There are contributed Type1 fonts in the
       contrib directory on export.lcs.mit.edu.
    7) New configuration method which allows the server's drivers and font
       renderers to be reconfigured from both source and binary
       distributions.
    8) Integrated support for 386BSD, Mach, and Linux.
    9) A monochrome version of the server which will run on generic VGA
       cards is now included.

   The following key features were added with the release of XFree86 1.2
   (they were not in XFree86 1.1):

    1) The monochrome server has been enhanced to do bank-switching of
       available SVGA memory to allow virtual screens up to 1600x1200 
       (see the X386(1) manual page for more information).
    2) Support for the Hercules mono card has been added to the
       monochrome server, and with it the ability to support a "two
       headed" server - one VGA, and one Hercules.  So far this has only
       been tested on SVR4 (it is also reported to work under Linux).
    3) SVR3 shared libraries, tested under ISC SVR3 2.2 and 3.0.1.
    4) Support for SVR4.2 (There are some special considerations to
       consider, due to new USL bugs; see the README.SVR4 file for
       more information.)
    5) Support for PS/2 mice, and Logitech MouseMan/TrackMan (some 
       versions of these devices were not previously compatible).
    6) A new tutorial on how to develop correct video card and monitor
       timing data, written by Eric Raymond (derived from previous
       documentation and a lot of experimentation).
    7) Greatly improved support for international keyboards, including
       implementation of the Compose key functionality found on many 
       vendor servers (see the X386keybd(1) manual page for more 
       information).
    8) The accuracy with which the server detects SVGA pixel clocks has
       been improved, and the timings are now stored at accuracies of
       0.1 MHz.  Users may want to consider removing an existing Clocks
       line from their Xconfig file and re-probing using the new server.
    9) Many enhancements in error handling and parsing of the Xconfig
       configuration file.  Error messages are much more informative
       and intuitive, and more validation is done.  There are many new
       options that can be enabled in the Xconfig file (see the X386(1) 
       manual page for more information on the format of this file).

       Plus a number of other small things.  Refer to the CHANGELOG file
       in the source distribution for full details.

   Also included are a tutorial on monitor timing by Eric Raymond, and the
   current X386 mode database and a sample xdm configuration by David Wexelblat.

4. What OSs are supported?

    XFree86 supports:
	SVR4.2: Consensys V4.2
	SVR4.0: Microport, Dell, Esix, ISC, AT&T, MST, Consensys, UHC
	SVR3: ISC 2.2 & 3.0, AT&T 2.2
	Linux, Mach 386, 386BSD 0.1

	BSD/386 is not supported, but it should work. The most active
	BSD/386 person is Greg Lehey <grog@lemis.de>.

	Note that Esix 3.2D and SCO are not supported yet,
	but anyone should feel free to submit patches.
	If you are interested in tackling this, send mail to
	xfree86@physics.su.oz.au

5. What video hardware is supported?

   At this time, XFree86 1.2 supports the following SVGA chipsets:

	Tseng ET4000
	Tseng ET3000
	Paradise PVGA1
	Western Digital WD90C00, WD90C10, WD90C11 (these are supersets of
		the PVGA1, and use its driver)
	Genoa GVGA
	Trident TVGA8900C, TVGA9000
	ATI 18800, 28800

	All of the above are supported in both 256 color and monochrome modes,
	with the exception of the ATI chipsets, which are only supported in
	256 color mode.

	The monochrome server also supports generic VGA cards, using 64k of
	video memory in a single bank, and the Hercules card.  On the
	ET3000, only 64k of video memory is supported for the monochrome
	server, and the GVGA has not been tested with more than 64k.

	It appears that some of the SVGA card manufacturers are going to
	non-traditional mechanisms for selecting pixel-clock frequencies.  To
	avoid having to modify the server to accommodate these schemes XFree86
	1.2 adds support for using an external program to select the pixel
	clock.  This allows programs to be written as new mechanisms are
	discovered.  Refer to the README.clkprog file for information on how
	these programs work, if you need to write one.  If you do develop such
	a program, the XFree86 team would be interested in including it with
	future XFree86 releases.

	If you are purchasing new hardware for the purpose of using XFree86,
	it is suggested that you purchase an ET4000-based board such as the
	Orchid ProDesigner IIs.  Avoid recent Diamond boards; XFree86 will not
	work with them, because Diamond won't provide programming details.
	In fact, the XFree86 project is actively not supporting new Diamond
	products, as long as such policies remain in effect.  Contributions
	of code will NOT be accepted (because of the potential liabilities).
	If you would like to see this change, tell Diamond about it.

	Some people have asked if XFree86 would work with local bus or EISA
	video cards. Theoretically, the means of communication between the
	CPU and the video card is irrelevant to Xfree86 compatibility. It
	could be ISA, EISA, or local bus.  What should matter is the chipset
	on the video card.  Unfortunately, the developers don't have a lot
	of access to EISA or VLB machines, so this is largely an untested
	theory.  However, we have yet to see any reports of things not
	working on one of these buses and we have several reports of Xfree86
	working fine on them.

6. What about accelerated boards?

	At this time, there is no support in XFree86 for accelerated boards
	like the S3, ATI Ultra (8514/A), TIGA, etc.  This support is available
	in commercial products from SGCS and MetroLink (for SVR3 and SVR4).

	An S3 server is available for 386BSD and Linux.  Contact
	<hasty@netcom.com> for 386BSD or <jon@robots.ox.ac.uk> for Linux.

	A beta 8514/A server is available for Linux. Contact <martin@cs.unc.edu>
	or <jon@robots.ox.ac.uk>. Note: these servers are NOT part of XFree86.

7. Why doesn't XFree86 support 16-color VGA modes?

	The reason that this is not supported is the way VGA implements the
	16-color modes.  In 256-color modes, each byte of frame buffer memory
	contains 1 pixel.  But the 16-color modes are implemented as bit-
	planes.  Each byte of frame- buffer memory contains 1 bit from each
	of each of 8 pixels, and there are four such planes.  The MIT frame-
	buffer code is not designed to deal with this.  If VGA handled
	16-color modes by packing 2 4-bit pixels into each byte, the MIT code
	could be modified to support this (or it already may; I'm not sure).
	But for the VGA way of doing things, a complete new frame-buffer
	implementation is required.  Some beta testers are looking into this,
	but nothing is yet available from the project.

8. What other hardware or software requirements are there?

	Obviously, a supported SVGA board and OS are required.  To run
	X efficiently, 12-16MB of memory should be considered a minimum.
	The various binary releases take 10-40MB of disk space, depending
	on the OS (e.g. whether or not it supports shared libraries).
	To build from sources, at least 80MB of free disk space will
	be required, although 120MB should be considered a comfortable 
	lower bound.

9. Where can I get source for XFree86?

	Source patches for the current version (1.2, based on X11R5 PL22
	from MIT), are available via anonymous FTP from:
		export.lcs.mit.edu (under /contrib/XFree86)
		ftp.physics.su.oz.au (under /XFree86)
		ftp.win.tue.nl (under /pub/XFree86)
	(For the rest of this FAQ, these 3 location will be called $FTP)

	Refer to the README file under the specified directory for information
	on which files you need to get to build your distribution.

10. Where can I get binaries for XFree86?

	Binaries are available via anonymous FTP from:
		ftp.physics.su.oz.au		- SVR4 binaries
			under /XFree86/SVR4
		ftp.win.tue.nl			- SVR4 binaries
			under /pub/XFree86/SVR4
		ferkel.ucsb.edu			- SVR4 binaries
			under /pub/SVR4/XFree86
		stasi.bradley.edu		- SVR4 binaries
			under /pub/XFree86/SVR4
		blancmange.ma.utexas.edu	- SVR3 (ISC) binaries
			under /pub/ISC
		ftp.prz.tu-berlin.de            - SVR3 (ISC) binaries
			under /pub/pc/isc/XFree86
		tsx-11.mit.edu			- Linux binaries
			under /pub/linux/packages/X11
		agate.berkeley.edu		- 386BSD binaries
			under /pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86
		ftp.cs.uwm.edu			- Mach binaries
			under /i386

	Ensure that you are getting XFree86 1.2 - some of these sites may
	archive older releases as well.  Each binary distribution will
	contain a README file that describes what files you need to take
	from the archive, and which compile-time option selections were
	made when building the distribution.

IV) What general things should I know about running XFree86?

11. Installation directories

	The top-level installation directory is specified by the ProjectRoot
	(/usr/X386, by default) variable in config/site.def. Binaries, include
	files, and libraries are installed in $ProjectRoot/{bin,include,lib}.

	This can be changed when rebuilding from sources, and can be modified
	via symbolic links for those OSs that support them. This directory is
	nonstandard, and was chosen this way to allow XFree86 to be installed
	alongside a commercial/vendor-supplied X implementation.

12. Configuration files

	The XFree86 server reads a configuration file ("Xconfig") on startup.
	The search path, contents and syntax for this file are documented in
	the server manpage, which should be consulted before asking questions.

13. Determining VGA dot clocks and monitor modes

	David E Wexelblat (dwex@mtgzfs3.att.com) maintains a database of known
	clock settings for VGA cards and monitor settings.
	The database is installed in /usr/X386/lib/X11/etc/modeDB.txt, and
	is in the source tree under mit/server/ddx/x386/etc. This database is
	also available from him (for the latest copy), and is kept on
	export.lcs.mit.edu in ~/contrib/X386.modeDB.Z, which is updated
	occasionally.  Obtain a copy of this database.  It just might have the
	settings you need.  If you create new settings, please send them to
	David for inclusion in the database.

	If this doesn't help you, the VideoModes.doc (by Eric Raymond) file 
	with XFree86 contains tutorials on how to come up with these timings.
	It may be helpful to start with settings that almost work, and use
	this description to get them right.  When you do, send the information
	to David Wexelblat for inclusion in the database.

	NOTE: The old 'clock.exe' program is not supported any more, and
	      is completely unnecessary.  If you need to determine dot
	      clock values for a new board, remove the 'Clocks' line from
	      your Xconfig file (if present), and start the server.  The
	      server will probe for clocks itself and print them out.
	      You can use these values to put a 'Clocks' line into your
	      Xconfig file, which is not necessary, but will speed up
	      starting the server in the future.

14. Rebuilding/reconfiguring the server from the link kit

	If you have installed the server Binary Link Kit, it is possible to
	reconfigure the drivers and font renderers in the server.  This is
	fully explained in the README file that is available with the link kit.

V) What OS-specific things should I know about running XFree86?

	First of all, the server must be installed suid-root (mode 4755).

15. SVR4
	Why won't my xterm run properly?

	If your kernel is not built with the consem module, you should define
	CONSEM=no in you environment. Otherwise xterm won't run.
	csh users should use 'setenv CONSEM no'

	The Esix console driver patch 403019 is known to cause keymapping
	problems with XFree86.  It recommended that this patch not be
	installed.  Alternatively they keymap can be fixed with xmodmap.

16. SVR3

	Make sure you look at $FTP/README.ISC, if that's what you are running.

17. 386BSD

	Make sure you look at $FTP/README.386BSD.

	Also, a separate 386BSD FAQ is maintained by Richard Murphey
	<Rich@Rice.edu>.  The latest version should be available in the
	file XFree86-1.2-386BSD-FAQ at the following ftp sites:

	    agate.berkeley.edu:/pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2
	    wuarchive.wustl.edu:/mirrors4/386bsd/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2
	    grasp1.univ-lyon1.fr:pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2

18. Linux

	You must be running Linux 0.97pl4 or greater, and have the 4.1 gcc
	jump libraries installed.

	Make sure the binaries X386, X386mono, xload and xterm are setuid root.

	If your kernel doesn't have TCP support compiled in, you'll have to
	run the server as "X -pn". The default startup configuration assumes
	that TCP is not available. If it is, change the two files
	/usr/X386/bin/startx and /usr/X386/lib/X11/xdm/Xservers, removing the
	-pn argument to X386.

	Make sure /dev/console is either a link to /dev/tty0 or has the major
	number 4, minor number 0. Also note that if /dev/console is not
	owned by the user running X, then xconsole and xterm will not permit
	console output redirection. Xdm will properly change the owner, but
	startx won't.

	When running xdm from rc.local, you will need to provide it with
	a tty, for example "xdm < /dev/console &".

	For more detailed information, please read the file README present
	with the distribution on tsx-11.mit.edu.

19. Mach

	Make sure you look at $FTP/README.Mach.

VI) What things should I know for building XFree86 from source?

	This section has been removed from the FAQ, since it is
	fully explained in $FTP/README and the OS-specific READMEs.
	Please look at those files for information on building XFree86.

VII) Is there anything special about building clients with XFree86?

20. BSD compatibility library

	A lot of clients make use of BSD functions like bcopy(), etc.
	The default configuration files are set up to link with libXbsd.a
	which contains emulation for bcopy(), bzero(), bcmp(), ffs(), random(),
	seed(). A better way of providing the 'b' functions is to include
	<X11/Xfuncs.h> in source files that call them.  Xfuncs.h provides macro
	definitions for these in terms of the SYSV 'mem' functions.  If you are
	linking with a vendor supplied library which calls some of these
	functions, then you should link with libXbsd.a

21. ANSICCOPTIONS

	This is something that was added to allow a developer to get rid of the
	ANSI-ness defined in the default CCOPTIONS without having to rewrite
	the entire CCOPTIONS line.  For example, with stock MIT, you'd see
	something like
		CCOPTIONS="-ansi -O2 -fwritable-strings"
	and to get rid of the ANSI-ness, the developer would have to put
		CCOPTIONS="-O2 -fwritable-strings"
	in his Imakefile.  With this change, you would see a default of
		ANSICCOPTIONS="-ansi"
		CCOPTIONS="-O2 -fwritable-strings"
	and all the developer would have to put in the Imakefile is:
		ANSICCOPTIONS=
	to get rid of the ANSI-ness (many X clients will die a horrible death
	with -ansi).  The effect is even more dramatic in practice, because
	CCOPTIONS is actually quite complex.  The other issue is that one must
	add 'ANSICCOPTIONS=$(ANSICCOPTIONS)' to a PassCDebugFlags definition.

XGOALS OF THE CONTEST:
X
X    * To write the most Obscure/Obfuscated C program under the rules below.
X    * To show the importance of programming style, in an ironic way.
X    * To stress C compilers with unusual code.
X    * To illustrate some of the subtleties of the C language.
X    * To provide a safe forum for poor C code.  :-)
X
X
XRULES:
X
X    To help us with the volume of entries, we ask that you follow these rules:
X
X    1) Your entry must be a complete program.
X
X    2) Your entry must be <= 3217 bytes in length.  The number of characters
X       excluding whitespace (tab, space, newline), and excluding any ; { or }
X       followed by either whitespace or end of file, must be <= 1536.
X
X    3) Your entry must be submitted in the following format:
X
X---entry---
Xrule:	1993
Xfix:	y or n   (n => this is a new entry, y => this replaces an older entry)
Xtitle:	title of entry  		    (see comments below)
Xentry:	Entry number from 0 to 7 inclusive  (your 1st entry should by 0)
Xdate:	Date/time of submission in UTC	    (see comments below)
Xhost:	Machine(s) and OS(s) under which your entry was tested
X	Use tab indented lines if needed
X---remark---
X    Place remarks about this entry in this section.  It would be helpful if
X    you were to indent your remarks with 4 spaces, though it is not a
X    requirement.  Also, if possible, try to avoid going beyond the 79th
X    column.  Blank lines are permitted.
X---author---
Xname:	your name
Xorg:	School/Company/Organization
Xaddr:	postal address
X	use tab indented lines to continue
X	don't forget to include the country
Xemail:  Email address from a well known site or registered domain.
X        If you give several forms, list them on separate tab indented lines.
Xanon:	y or n   (y => remain anonymous, n => ok to publish this info)
X---info---
XIf your program needs an info file, place a uuencoded copy of it in
Xthis section.  In the case of multiple info files, use multiple info
Xsections.  If your entry does not need a info file, skip this section.
X---build---
XPlace a uuencoded copy of the command(s) used to compile/build your program
Xin this section.  It must uudecode into a file named 'build'.  The resulting
Xfile must be 255 bytes or less.
X---program---
XPlace a uuencoded copy of your program in this section.  It must uudecode
Xinto a file named is 'prog.c'.  The resulting file must follow rule #2.
X---end---
X
X      Regarding the above format:
X
X	* The title must match the expression: [a-zA-Z0-9_=][a-zA-Z0-9_=+-]*
X	  and must be 1 to 12 characters in length.
X
X	  It is suggested, but not required, that the title should
X	  incorporate your username; in the case of multiple authors,
X	  consider using parts of the usernames of the authors.
X
X	* The date in the ---entry--- section should be given with respect
X	  to UTC.  The format of the date should be as returned by asctime() 
X	  using the C locale.  (see guidelines for more info)
X
X	* You may correct/revise a previously submitted entry by sending
X	  it to the contest email address.  Be sure to set 'fix' in the 
X	  ---entry--- section to 'n'.  The corrected entry must use the same 
X	  title and entry number as submittion that is being corrected.  Be 
X	  sure that you note the resubmittion in the ---remark--- as well.
X
X	* With the exception of the header, all text outside of the above 
X	  format may be ignored by the judges.  If you need tell the judges
X	  something, put it in the ---remark--- section, or send a separate
X	  Email message to the judges.
X
X	* Information from the ---author--- section will be published unless 
X	  'y' was given to the respective author's 'anon' line.
X
X	* To credit multiple authors, include an ---author--- section for
X	  each author.  Each should start with ---author--- line, and
X	  should be found between the ---entry--- and ---build--- sections.
X
X	* The entry's remarks should include:
X	    - what this program does
X	    - how to run the program (sample args or input)
X	    - special compile or execution instructions, if any
X	    - special filename requirements (see rule 4 and 5)
X	    - information about any ---data--- files
X	    - why you think the program is obfuscated
X	    - note if this entry is a re-submission of a previous entry.
X	    - any other remarks (humorous or otherwise)
X
X	* Do not rot13 your entry's remarks.  You may suggest that certain
X	  portions of your remarks be rot13ed if your entry wins an award.
X
X        * Info files should be used only to supplement your entry.  They 
X	  should not be required to exist.
X
X	  If your entry does not need an info file, skip the ---info---
X	  section.  If your entry needs multiple info files, use multiple 
X	  ---info--- sections, one per info file.  You should describe
X	  each info file in the ---remark--- section.
X
X    4) If your entry is selected as a winner, it will be modified as follows:
X
X	   'build' is incorporated into a makefile, and 'build' is removed
X	   'prog.c' is renamed to your entry's title, followed by an optional
X	       digit, followed by '.c'
X	   your entry is compiled into a file with the name of your entry's
X	       title, possibly followed by a digit
X
X       If your entry requires that a build file exist, state so in your
X       entry's remark section.  The makefile will be arranged to execute a
X       build shell script containing the 'build' information.  The name of
X       this build shell script will be your entry's title, possibly followed
X       by a digit, followed by '.sh'.
X
X       If needed, your entry's remarks should indicate how your entry must
X       be changed in order to deal with the new filenames.
X
X    5) The build file, the source and the resulting executable should be
X       treated as read-only files.  If your entry needs to modify these files,
X       it should make and modify a copy of the appropriate file.  If this
X       occurs, state so in your entry's remarks.
X
X    6) Entries that cannot be compiled by an ANSI C compiler will be rejected.
X       Use of common C (K&R + extensions) is permitted, as long as it does not 
X       cause compile errors for ANSI C compilers.
X
X    7) The program must be of original work.  All programs must be in the
X       public domain.  All copyrighted programs will be rejected.
X
X    8) Entries must be received prior to 07-May-93 0:00 UTC.  (UTC is
X       essentially equivalent to Greenwich Mean Time)  Email your entries to:
X
X		...!{apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!obfuscate
X		obfuscate@toad.com
X
X       We request that your message use the subject 'ioccc entry'.
X
X       If possible, we request that you hold off on Emailing your entries
X       until 1-Mar-93 0:00 UTC.  Early entries will be accepted, however.
X       We will attempt to email a confirmation to the the first author for
X       all entries received after 1-Mar-93 0:00 UTC.
X
X    9) Each person may submit up to 8 entries per contest year.  Each entry
X       must be sent in a separate Email letter.
X
X   10) Entries requiring human interaction to be built are not allowed.  
X       Compiling an entry produce a file (or files) which may be executed.
X
X   11) Programs that require special privileges (setuid, setgid, super-user,
X       special owner or group) are not allowed.
X

X10th International Obfuscated C Code Contest Guidelines, Hints and Comments

XAll Rights Reserved.  Permission for personal, education or non-profit use is

X
XABOUT THIS FILE:
X
X    This file is intended to help people who wish to submit entries to
X    the International Obfuscated C Code Contest (IOCCC for short).
X
X    This is not the IOCCC rules, though it does contain comments about
X    them.  The guidelines should be viewed as hints and suggestions.
X    Entries that violate the guidelines but remain within the rules are
X    allowed.  Even so, you are safer if you remain within the guidelines.
X
X    You should read the current IOCCC rules, prior to submitting entries.
X    The rules are typically sent out with these guidelines.
X
X
XWHAT IS NEW IN 1993:
X
X    The entry format is better (for us anyway).  The program mkentry.c
X    has been updated.  See ENTRY FORMAT.
X
X    We will reject entries that cannot be compiled using an ANSI C
X    compiler.  Certain old Obfuscation hacks that cause ANSI C compilers 
X    fits are no longer permitted.  Some of the new issues deal with 
X    non-integral array types, variable number of arguments, C preprocessor 
X    directives and the exit() function.  See OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES.
X
X
XHINTS AND SUGGESTIONS:
X
X    You are encouraged to examine the winners of previous contests.  See
X    FOR MORE INFORMATION for details on how to get previous winners.
X
X    Keep in mind that rules change from year to year, so some winning entries
X    may not be valid entries this year.  What was unique and novel one year
X    might be 'old' the next year.
X
X    An entry is usually examined in a number of ways.  We typically apply
X    a number of tests to an entry:
X
X	* look at the original source
X	* convert ANSI tri-graphs to ASCII
X	* C pre-process the source ignoring '#include' lines
X	* C pre-process the source ignoring '#define' and '#include' lines
X	* run it through a C beautifier
X	* examine the algorithm
X	* lint it
X	* compile it
X	* execute it
X
X    You should consider how your entry looks in each of the above tests.
X    You should ask yourself if your entry remains obscure after it has been
X    'cleaned up' by the C pre-processor and a C beautifier.
X
X    Your entry need not do well under all, or in most tests.  In certain
X    cases, a test is not important.  Entries that compete for the
X    'strangest/most creative source layout' need not do as well as
X    others in terms of their algorithm.  On the other hand, given
X    two such entries, we are more inclined to pick the entry that
X    does something interesting when you run it.
X
X    We try to avoid limiting creativity in our rules.  As such, we leave
X    the contest open for creative rule interpretation.  As in real life
X    programming, interpreting a requirements document or a customer request
X    is important.  For this reason, we often award 'worst abuse of the
X    rules' to an entry that illustrates this point in an ironic way.
X
X    If you do plan to abuse the rules, we suggest that you let us know
X    in the remarks section.  Please note that an invitation to abuse
X    is not an invitation to break.  We are strict when it comes to the
X    3217 byte size limit.  Also, abusing the entry format tends to
X    annoy more than amuse.
X
X    We do realize that there are holes in the rules, and invite entries
X    to attempt to exploit them.  We will award 'worst abuse of the rules'
X    and then plug the hole next year.  Even so, we will attempt to use
X    the smallest plug needed, if not smaller.  :-)
X
X    Check out your program and be sure that it works.  We sometimes make
X    the effort to debug an entry that has a slight problem, particularly
X    in or near the final round.  On the other hand, we have seen some
X    of the best entries fall down because they didn't work.
X
X    We tend to look down on a prime number printer, that claims that
X    16 is a prime number.  If you do have a bug, you are better off
X    documenting it.  Noting "this entry sometimes prints the 4th power
X    of a prime by mistake" would save the above entry.  And sometimes,
X    a strange bug/feature can even help the entry!  Of course, a correctly
X    working entry is best.
X
X
XOUR LIKES AND DISLIKES:
X
X    Doing masses of #defines to obscure the source has become 'old'.  We
X    tend to 'see thru' masses of #defines due to our pre-processor tests
X    that we apply.  Simply abusing #defines or -Dfoo=bar won't go as far
X    as a program that is more well rounded in confusion.
X
X    Many ANSI C compilers dislike the following code, and so do we:
X
X	#define d define
X	#d foo		   <-- don't expect this to turn into #define foo
X
X	int i;
X	j;		   <-- don't use such implicit type declaration
X	int k;
X
X    We suggest that you compile your entry with an ANSI C compiler.  If you 
X    must use non-ANSI C, such as K&R C, you must avoid areas that result in 
X    compile/link errors for ANSI C compilers.
X
X    Unfortunately, ANSI C requires array indexes to be of integral type.
X    Thus, the following classical obfuscation hacks are no longer allowed:
X
X	int i;
X	char *c;
X	i[c];		   <--- use c[i] instead
X	(i+3)["string"];   <--- use "string"[i+3] instead
X
X    If your entry uses functions that have a variable number of
X    arguments, be careful. Systems implement va_list as a wide variety
X    of ways.  Because of this, a number of operations using va_list are
X    not portable and must not be used:
X
X	* assigning a non-va_list variable to/from a va_list variable
X	* casting a non-va_list variable into/from a va_list variable
X	* passing a va_list variable to a function expecting a non-va_list arg
X	* passing a non-va_list variable to a function expecting a va_list arg
X	* performing arithmetic on va_list variables
X	* using va_list as a structure or union
X
X    In particular, do not treat va_list variables as if they were a char **'s.
X
X    Avoid using <varargs.h>, use <stdarg.h> instead.
X
X    If you use C preprocessor directives (#define, #if, #ifdef, ...),
X    the leading '#' must be the first character on a line.  While some
X    C preprocessors allow whitespace the leading '#', many do not.
X
X    Because the exit() function returns void on some systems, entries
X    must not assume that it returns an int.
X
X    Small programs are best when they are short, obscure and concise.
X    While such programs are not as complex as other winners, they do
X    serve a useful purpose.  They are often the only program that people
X    attempt to completely understand.  For this reason, we look for
X    programs that are compact, and are instructional.
X
X    One line programs should be short one line programs, say around 80
X    bytes long.  Getting close to 160 bytes is a bit too long in our opinion.
X
X    We tend to dislike programs that:
X
X	* are very hardware specific
X	* are very OS or Un*x version specific
X	     (index/strchr differences are ok, but socket/streams specific
X	      code is likely not to be)
X	* dump core or have compiler warnings
X	     (it is ok only if you warn us in the 'remark' header item)
X	* won't compile under both BSD or SYS V Un*x
X	* abusing the build file to get around the size limit
X	* obfuscate by excessive use of ANSI tri-graphs
X	* are longer than they need to be
X	* are similar to previous winners
X	* are identical to previous losers  :-)
X
X    Unless you are cramped for space, or unless you are entering the
X    'best one liner' category, we suggest that you format your program
X    in a more creative way than simply forming excessively long lines.
X
X    The build file should not be used to try and get around the size
X    limit.  It is one thing to make use of a several -D's to help out,
X    but it is quite another to use 200+ bytes of -D's in order to
X    try and squeeze the source under the size limit.  You should feel
X    free to make use of the build file space, but you are better off
X    if you show some amount of restraint.
X
X    We allowed whitespace, and in certain cases ; { or } do not impact
X    your program size (up to a certain point), because we want to get
X    away from source that is simply a compact blob of characters.
X
X    Given two versions of the same program, one that is a compact blob
X    of code, and the other that is formatted more like a typical C
X    program, we tend to favor the second version.  Of course, a third
X    version of the same program that is formatted in an interesting
X    and/or obfuscated way, would definitely win over the first two!
X
X    We suggest that you avoid trying for the 'smallest self-replicating'
X    program.  We are amazed at the many different sizes that claim
X    to be the smallest.  There is nothing wrong with self-replicating
X    programs.  In fact, a number of winners have been self-replicating.
X    You might want to avoid the claim of 'smallest', lest we (or others)
X    know of a smaller one!
X
X    X client entries should be as portable as possible.  Entries that
X    adapt to a wide collection of environments will be favored.  Don't
X    depend on a particular type of display.  For example, don't depend
X    on color or a given size.  Don't require backing store.
X
X    X client entries should avoid using X related libraries and
X    software that is not in wide spread use.  We ask that such X client
X    entries restrict themselves to only the low level Xlib and the
X    Athena widget set (libX11.a, libXaw.a, libXmu.a and libXt.a).
X    Don't use M*tif, Xv*ew, or OpenL*ok toolkits, since not everyone
X    has them.  Avoid depending on a particular window manager.  Not
X    everyone has X11r5, and some people are stuck back in X11r4 (or
X    earlier), so try to target X11r5 without requiring X11r5.  Better
X    yet, try to make your entry run on all version 11 X Window Systems.
X
X    X client entries should not to depend on particular items on
X    .Xdefaults.  If you must do so, be sure to note the required lines
X    in the ---remark--- section.
X
X    We like programs that:
X
X	* are as concise and small as they need to be
X	* do something at least quasi-interesting
X	* pass lint without complaint (not a requirement, but it is nice)
X	* are portable
X	* are unique or novel in their obfuscation style
X	* MAKE USE OF A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF OBFUSCATION
X	* make us laugh and/or throw up  :-)
X
X    Some types of programs can't excel in some areas.  Of course, your
X    program doesn't have to excel in all areas, but doing well in several
X    areas really does help.
X
X    We freely admit that interesting, creative or humorous comments in
X    the ---remark--- section helps your chance of winning.  If you had to
X    read of many twisted entries, you too would enjoy a good laugh or two.
X    We think the readers of the contest winners do as well.
X
X    Be creative!
X
X
XENTRY FORMAT:
X
X    In order to help us process the many entries, we must request your
X    assistance by formatting your entries in a certain way.  This format,
X    in addition, allows us to quickly separate information about the
X    author from the program itself.  (see JUDGING PROCESS)
X
X    We have provided the program, mkentry, as an example of how to
X    format entries.  You should be aware of the following warning that
X    is found in mkentry.c:
X
X	This program attempts to implement the IOCCC rules.  Every
X	attempt has been made to make sure that this program produces
X	an entry that conforms to the contest rules.  In all cases,
X	where this program differs from the contest rules, the
X	contest rules will be used.  Be sure to check with the
X	contest rules before submitting an entry.
X
X    You are not required to use mkentry.  It is convenient, however,
X    as it attempts to uuencode the needed files, and attempt to check
X    the entry against the size rules.
X
X    If you have any suggestions, comments, fixes or complaints about
X    the mkentry.c program, please send Email to the judges.  (see below)
X
X    The following is a sample entry:
X
X---entry---
Xrule:	1993
Xfix:	n
Xtitle:	chonglab
Xentry:	0
Xdate:	Mon Mar  1 08:45:20 1993
Xhost:	Un*x v6, pdp11/45
X	2.9BSD, pdp11/70
X---remark---
X    This is a non-obfuscated obfuscated C program.
X
X    It is likely not to win a prize.  But what do you expect from
X    a short example!

X
X    Typically the build file should assume that the source is prog.c
X    and will compile into prog.  If an entry wins, we will rename
X    its source and binary to avoid filename collision.  By tradition,
X    we use the name of the entry's title, followed by an optional
X    digit in case of name conflicts.
X
X    If the above entry somehow won the 'least likely to win' award,
X    we would use chonglab.c and chonglab.
X
X    If your entry depends on, or requires that your build, source
X    and/or binary files be a particular name, please say so in the
X    ---remark--- section.  If this case applies, it would be be helpful
X    if you did one of the following:
X
X	* Tell us how to change the filename(s) in your entry.
X
X	* Have the build file make copies of the files.  For example:
X
X		cc prog.c -o special_name		need special binary
X
X	    or  rm -f special_src.c			need special source
X		cp prog.c special_src.c
X		cc special_src.c -o special_name
X
X	    or  rm -f special_build			need special build
X		tail +4 build > special_build
X		sh < special_build
X
X	* Assume that we will use the entry title.  Send us a version of 
X	  your build/program files that uses the name convention.  You 
X	  should uuencode these files in ---data--- sections.
X
X    If your entry needs to modify its source, info or binary files,
X    please say so in the ---remark--- section.  You should try to avoid
X    touching your original build, source and binary files.  You should
X    arrange to make copies of the files you intend to modify.  This
X    will allow people to re-generate your entry from scratch.
X
X    Remember that your entry may be built without a build file.  We
X    typically incorporate the build lines into a Makefile.  If the
X    build file must exist, say so in the ---remark--- section.
X
X    If your entry needs special info files, you should uuencode them
X    into ---info--- sections.  In the case of multiple info files,
X    use multiple ---info--- sections.  If no info files are needed,
X    then skip the ---info--- section.
X
X    Info files are intended to be input, or detailed information that
X    does not fit well into the ---remark--- section.  For example, an
X    entry that implements a compiler might want to provide some sample
X    programs for the user to compile.  An entry might want to include a
X    lengthy design document, that might not be appropriate for a
X    'hints' file.
X
X    Info files should be used only to supplement your entry.  For
X    example, info files may provide sample input or detailed
X    information about your entry.  Because they are supplemental,
X    the entry should not require them exist.
X
X    In some cases, your info files might be renamed to avoid name
X    conflicts.  If info files should not be renamed for some reason,
X    say so in the ---remark--- section.
X
X    Info files must uudecode into the current directory.  If they
X    absolutely must be renamed, or moved into a sub-directory, say
X    so in the ---remark--- section.
X
X    When submitting multiple entries, be sure that each entry has
X    a unique entry number from 0 to 7.  Your first entry should
X    have entry number 0.
X
X    With the exception of the header, all text outside of the entry
X    format may be ignored.  That is, don't place text outside of the
X    entry and expect the judges to see it.  (Our decoding tools aren't
X    AI progs!) If you need tell the the something, put it in the 
X    ---remark--- section, or send a Email to the judges at:
X
X	...!{apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!judges	(not the address for
X	judges@toad.com					 submitting entries)
X    
X    The date should be given with respect to UTC.  (Some systems refer 
X    to this as GMT or GMT0)  The format of the date should be that as 
X    returned by asctime() in the C locale.  An example of such a string is:
X
X	Thr Apr 01 00:47:00 1993
X
X    This format is similar to the output of the date(1) command.  The
X    string does not include the timezone name before the year.  On many 
X    systems, one of the following command will produce a similar string:
X
X	date -u "+%a %h %d %T 19%y"
X	date -u | sed -e 's/... \(19[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/'
X	sh -c 'TZ=UTC date | sed -e "s/... \(19[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/"'
X	sh -c 'TZ=GMT date | sed -e "s/... \(19[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/"'
X	sh -c 'TZ=GMT0 date | sed -e "s/... \(19[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/"'
X
X    You are allowed to update/fix/revise your entry.  To do so, set
X    the 'fix' line in the ---entry--- section to 'y' instead of 'n'.
X    Be sure that the resubmittion uses the same title and entry number
X    as well, as these are used to determine which entry is to be
X    replaced.
X
X
XJUDGING PROCESS:
X
X    Entries are judged by Larry Bassel and Landon Curt Noll.
X
X    Entries are unpacked into individual directories.  The Email message
X    is unpacked into individual files, each containing:
X
X	---entry--- section
X	all ---author--- sections
X	all ---info--- sections
X	---build--- section
X	---program--- section
X	any other text, including the Email message headers
X
X    Prior to judging, the 'any other text' file is scanned to be sure
X    it does not contain useful information (or in case the entry was
X    malformed and did not unpack correctly).  Information from the
X    ---author--- sections are not read until the judging process is
X    complete, and then only from entries that have won an award.
X
X    The above process helps keep us biased for/against any one particular
X    individual.  We are usually kept in the dark as much as you are
X    until the final awards are given.  We like the surprise of finding
X    out in the end, who won and where they were from.
X
X    We attempt to keep all entries anonymous, unless they win an award.
X    Because the main 'prize' of winning is being announced, we make all
X    attempts to send non-winners into oblivion.  We remove all non-winning
X    files, and shred all related paper.  By tradition, we do not even
X    reveal the number of entries that we received.  (for the curious,
X    we do indicate the volume of paper consumed when presenting the IOCCC
X    winners at talks)
X
X    After the Usenix announcement, we attempt to send Email to the
X    authors of the winning entries.  One reason we do this is to give
X    the authors a chance to comment on the way we have presented their
X    entry.  They are given the chance to correct mistakes, typos.  We
X    often accept their suggestions/comments about our remarks as well.
X    This is done prior to posting the winners to the wide world.
X
X    Judging consists of a number of elimination rounds.  During a round,
X    the collection of entries are divided into two roughly equal piles;
X    the pile that advances on to the next round, and the pile that does
X    not.  We also re-examine the entries that were eliminated in the
X    previous round.  Thus, an entry gets at least two readings.
X
X    A reading consists of a number of actions:
X
X	* reading the ---entry--- section
X	* reading the uudecoded ---build--- section
X	* reading the uudecoded ---program--- section
X	* reading the uudecoded ---info--- section(s), if any
X	* passing the source thru the C pre-processor
X	    shipping over any #include files
X	* performing a number of C beautify/cleanup edits on the source
X	* passing the beautified source thru the C pre-processor
X	    shipping over any #include files
X
X    In later rounds, other actions are performed:
X
X	* linting the source
X	* compiling/building the source
X	* running the program
X	* performing misc tests on the source and binary
X
X    Until we reduce the stack of entries down to about 25 entries, entries
X    are judged on an individual basis.  An entry is set aside because it
X    does not, in our opinion, meet the standard established by the round.
X    When the number of entries thins to about 25 entries, we begin to form
X    award categories.  Entries begin to compete with each other for awards.
X    An entry often will compete in several categories.
X
X    The actual award category list will vary depending on the types of entries
X    we receive.  A typical category list might be:
X
X	* best small one line program
X	* best small program
X	* strangest/most creative source layout
X	* most useful obfuscated program
X	* best game that is obfuscated
X	* most creatively obfuscated program
X	* most deceptive C code
X	* best X client (see OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES)
X	* best abuse of ANSI C
X	* worst abuse of the rules
X	* <anything else so strange that it deserves an award>
X
X    We do not limit ourselves to this list.  For example, a few entries are so
X    good/bad that they are declared winners at the start of the final round.
X    We will invent awards categories for them, if necessary.
X
X    In the final round process, we perform the difficult tasks of
X    reducing the remaining entries (typically about 25) down to 8 or 10
X    winners.  Often we are confident that the entries that make it into
X    the final round are definitely better than the ones that do not
X    make it.  The selection of the winners out of the final round, is
X    less clear cut.
X
X    Sometimes a final round entry good enough to win, but is beat out
X    by a similar, but slightly better entry.  For this reason, it is
X    sometimes worthwhile to re-enter an improved version of an entry 
X    that failed to win in a previous year.  This assumes, of course, 
X    that the entry is worth improving in the first place!
X
X    More often that not, we select a small entry (usually one line), a
X    strange/creative layout entry, and an entry that abuses the contest
X    rules in some way.
X
X    In the end, we traditionally pick one entry as 'best'.  Sometimes such
X    an entry simply far exceeds any of the other entry.  More often, the
X    'best' is picked because it does well in a number of categories.
X
X
XANNOUNCEMENT OF WINNERS:
X
X    The first announcement, occurs at a Summer Usenix conference.  By tradition,
X    this is done during the latter part of the UUNET/IOCCC BOF, just prior to
X    the Berkeley BSD, and BSDI BOF.
X
X    Winning entries will be posted in late June to the following groups:
X
X	    comp.lang.c		  comp.unix.wizards	alt.sources
X
X    In addition, pointers to these postings are posted to the following
X
X	    comp.sources.d	  alt.sources.d		misc.misc
X	    comp.sources.misc	  comp.windows.x
X
X    Winning entries will be deposited into the uunet archives.  See
X    below for details.
X
X    Often, winning entries are published in selected magazines.  Winners 
X    have appeared in books ("The New Hackers Dictionary") and on T-Shirts.
X
X    Last, but not least, winners receive international fame and flames!  :-)

X    10th International Obfuscated C Contest   
X    
X	"The original obfuscated contest"
X
X    Obfuscate:  tr.v.  -cated, -cating, -cates.  1. a.  To render obscure.
X                b.  To darken.  2. To confuse:  Their emotions obfuscated 
X		their judgment.  [LLat. obfuscare, to darken : ob(intensive) +
X                Lat. fuscare, to darken < fuscus, dark.] -obfuscation n.
X                obfuscatory adj.
X 
X    GOALS OF THE CONTEST:
X 
X        * To write the most Obscure/Obfuscated C program under the rules below.
X        * To show the importance of programming style, in an ironic way.
X        * To stress C compilers with unusual code.
X        * To illustrate some of the subtleties of the C language.
X        * To provide a safe forum for poor C code.  :-)
X 
X    The IOCCC is the grandfather of USENET programming contests.  Since
X    1984, this contest demonstrated that a program that mearly works
X    correctly is not sufficient.  The IOCCC has also done much to add
X    the arcane word 'obfuscated' back into the English language.
X    (see "The New Hacker's Dictionary" by Eric Raymond)
X 
X    You are strongly encouraged to read the new contest rules before
X    sending any entries.  The rules, and sometimes the contest Email
X    address itself, change over time.  A valid entry one year may
X    be rejected in a later year due to changes in the rules.  The typical
X    start date for contests is in early March.  Contest rules are normally not
X    finalized and posted until the beginning of the contest.  The typical 
X    closing date for contests are in early May.
X 
X    The contest rules are posted to comp.unix.wizards, comp.lang.c,
X    misc.misc, alt.sources and comp.sources.d.  If you do not have access 
X    to these groups, or if you missed the early March posting, you may 
X    request a copy from the judges, via Email, at;
X

X	By: Landon Noll & Larry Wall
X
X    This content is being planned.  Someday when Landon & Larry are not too 
X    busy, they will actually get around to posting the first set of rules!
X
X    Landon says: "Yes, I know that I said we would have a contest in 1993,
X		  but other existing projects got in the way.  Hopefully
X		  something will be developed after Nov 1993."

X                         Alena Lacova (alena@nikhef.nl)
X
X    A  contest of  programming skills  and  knowledge, exclusively  for the
X    PostScript programming language. Its purpose:
X
X    * To spread knowledge of PostScript and its details.
X    * To applaud those with the best tricks.
X    * To prove  that humans can  beat those damnable  machine generators at
X      their own game by writing  the most obscure and mysterious PostScript
X      programs ever.
X
X    Winners will receive the fame and attention that goes with having their
X    program entry posted as a winner to programmers world-wide.
X
X    The 1993 contest rules and results are available by ftp as
X    ``wilma.cs.brown.edu:pub/postscript/obfuscated*.shar'', or individually
X    in the obfuscated directory. The judges will post the 1994 rules
X    in November to comp.lang.postscript on Usenet, and other places.
X    Send questions to jgm@cs.brown.edu.
X
X    Categories include: Best Obfuscated PostScript, Best Artwork,
X    Most Compact, Best Interactive Program, Most Useful, and
X    anything so unusual and creative that it deserves an award.
X
X    The judges will choose the winners of each category.

I don't know a great deal about the support for C++ in UIM/X, but I can tell 
you that there is good support for it in TeleUSE.  In TeleUSE you can call any
C++ method from a "D" module.  What you can do then is to use the "D" language
for most of your interface code and then use C++ for you application code.

I should tell you that there is some real neat stuff coming out of TeleUSE soon
in regard to C++, but I can't give you many details.  You should talk to your local sales rep and get the lowdown on what they will be doing in the near furture.

If you want example code of how C++ integrates with TeleUSE you should look at
$TeleUSE/examples/Thermometer

This is a periodic posting intended to answer the Frequently Asked
Question: What is the DoD? It is posted the first of each month, with
an expiration time of over a month. Thus, unless your site's news
software is ill-mannered, this posting should always be available.
This WitDoDFAQ is crossposted to all four rec.motorcycles groups in an
attempt to catch most new users, and followups are directed to
rec.motorcycles.

Last changed 9-Feb-93 to add a message from the KotL, and a bit of
Halon.

			How do I get a DoD number?

If the most Frequently Asked Question in rec.motorcycles is "What is the
DoD?", then the second most Frequently Asked Question must be "How do I
get a DoD number?" That is as simple as asking the Keeper of the List
(KotL, accept no substitue Keepers) for a number. If you're feeling
creative, and your favorite number hasn't been taken already, you can
make a request, subject to KotL approval. (Warning, non-numeric, non-
base-10 number requests are likely to earn a flame from the KotL. Not
that you won't get it, but you _will_ pay for it.)

Oh, and just one little, tiny suggestion. Ask the KotL in e-mail. You'll
just be playing the lightning rod for flames if you post to the whole
net, and you'll look like a clueless newbie too.

By now you're probably asking "So who's the KotL already?". Well, as
John Sloan notes below, that's about the only real "secret" left around
here, but a few (un)subtle hints can be divulged. First, it is not myself,
nor anyone mentioned by name in this posting (maybe :-), though John was
the original KotL. Second, in keeping with the true spirit of Unix, the
KotL's first name is only two letters long, and can be spelled entirely
with hexadecimal characters. (2.5, the KotL shares his name with a line-
oriented text utility.) Third, he has occasionally been seen posting
messages bestowing new DoD numbers (mostly to boneheads with "weenie
mailers"). Fourth, there is reason to suspect the KotL of being a
Dead-Head.

***************** Newsflash: A message from the KotL ******************

Once you have surmounted this intellectual pinnacle and electronically
groveled to the KotL, please keep in mind that the KotL does indeed
work for a living, and occasionally must pacify its boss by getting
something done.  Your request may languish in mailer queue for (gasp!)
days, perhaps even (horrors!) a week or two.  During such times of
economic activity on the part of the KotL's employers, sending yet
another copy of your request will not speed processing of the queue (it
just makes it longer, verification of this phenominon is left as an
excersize for the reader).  If you suspect mailer problems, at least
annotate subsequent requests with an indication that a former request
was submitted, lest you be assigned multiple numbers (what, you think
the KotL *memorizes* the list?!?).

***********************************************************************

One more thing, the KotL says that its telepathic powers aren't what
they used to be. So provide some information for the list, will ya?
The typical DoD List entry contains number, name, state/country, &
e-mail address. For example:

0111:Ed Green:CA:ed.green@East.Sun.COM

(PS: While John mentions below that net access and a bike are the only
requirements for DoD membership, that's not strictly true these days, as
there are a number of Denizens who lack one or both.)

            "Denizens of Doom", by Bruce Tanner (DoD 0161)

      [Road Rider, August 1991, reprinted with Bruce's permission]

There is a group of motorcyclists that gets together and does all the normal 
things that a bunch of bikers do.  They discuss motorcycles and  
motorcycling, beverages, cleaning fluids, baklavah, balaclava, caltrops,  
helmets, anti-fog shields, spine protectors, aerodynamics, three-angle valve
seats, bird hits, deer whistles, good restaurants, racing philosophy, 
traffic laws, tickets, corrosion control, personalities, puns, double 
entendres, culture, absence of culture, first rides and friendship.  They 
argue with each other and plan rides together.

The difference between this group and your local motorcycle club is that, 
although they get together just about everyday, most have never seen each 
other face to face.  The members of this group live all over the known world 
and communicate with each other electronically via computer.

The computers range from laptops to multi-million dollar computer centers;  
the people range from college and university students to high-tech industry 
professionals to public-access electronic bulletin-board users.  Currently, 
rec.motorcycles (pronounced "wreck-dot-motorcycles," it's the file name for 
the group's primary on-line "meeting place") carries about 2250 articles per 
month;  it is read by an estimated 29,000 people.  Most of the frequent 
posters belong to a motorcycle club, the Denizens of Doom, usually referred 
to as the DoD.

The DoD started when motorcyclist John R. Nickerson wrote a couple of 
parodies designed to poke fun at motorcycle stereotypes.  Fellow computer 
enthusiast Bruce Robinson posted these articles under the pen name, "Denizen 
of Doom."  A while later Chuck Rogers signed off as DoD nr. 0003 Keeper of 
the Flame.  Bruce was then designated DoD nr. 0002, retroactively and, of 
course, Nickerson, the originator of the parodies, was given DoD nr. 0001.

The idea of a motorcycle club with no organization, no meetings and no rules 
appealed to many, so John Sloan -- DoD nr. 0011 -- became Keeper of the 
List, issuing DoD numbers to anyone who wanted one.  To date there have been 
almost 400 memberships issued to people all over the United States and 
Canada, as well as Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, France, 
Germany, Norway and Finland.

Keeper of the List Sloan eventually designed a club patch.  The initial run 
of 300 patches sold out immediately.  The profits from this went to the 
American Motorcycle Heritage Foundation.  Another AMHF fund raiser -- 
selling Denizens of Doom pins to members -- was started by Arnie Skurow a 
few months later.  Again, the project was successful and the profits were 
donated to the foundation.  So far, the Denizens have contributed over $1500 
to the AMA museum.  A plaque in the name of the Denizens of Doom now hangs 
in the Motorcycle Heritage Museum.

As often as possible, the DoD'ers crawl out from behind their CRTs and go 
riding together.  It turns out that the two largest concentrations of 
DoD'ers are centered near Denver/Boulder, Colorado, and in California's 
"Silicon Valley."  Consequently, two major events are the annual Assault on 
Rollins Pass in Colorado, and the Northern versus Southern California 
"Joust."

The Ride-and-Feed is a bike trip over Rollins Pass, followed by a big 
barbecue dinner.  The concept for the Joust is to have riders from Northern 
California ride south; riders from Southern California to ride north, 
meeting at a predesignated site somewhere in the middle.  An additional plan 
for 1991 is to hold an official Denizens of Doom homecoming in conjunction 
with the AMA heritage homecoming in Columbus, Ohio, in July.

Though it's a safe bet the the Denizens of Doom and their collective 
communications hub, rec.motorcycles, will not replace the more traditional 
motorcycle organizations, for those who prowl the electronic pathways in 
search of two-wheeled camaraderie, it's a great way for kindred spirits to 
get together.  Long may they flame.


"Live to Flame -- Flame to Live"	[centerbar]

This official motto of the Denizens of Doom refers to the ease with which 
you can gratuitously insult someone electronically, when you would not do 
anything like that face to face.  These insults are known as "flames";  
issuing them is called "flaming."  Flames often start when a member 
disagrees with something another member has posted over the network.  A 
typical, sophisticated, intelligent form of calm, reasoned rebuttal would be 
something like:  "What an incredibly stupid statement, you Spandex-clad 
poseur!"  This will guarantee that five other people will reply in defense 
of the original poster, describing just what they think of you, your riding 
ability and your cat.

          _The Denizens of Doom: The Saga Unfolds_

                  by John Sloan  DoD #0011

Periodically the question "What is DoD?" is raised. This is one of
those questions in the same class as "Why is the sky blue?", "If there
is a God, why is there so much suffering in the world?" and "Why do
women inevitably tell you that you're such a nice guy just before they
dump you?", the kinds of questions steeped in mysticism, tradition,
and philosophy, questions that have inspired research and discussion
by philosophers in locker rooms, motorcycle service bays, and in the
halls of academe for generations. 

A long, long time ago (in computer time, where anything over a few
minutes is an eternity and the halting problem really is a problem) on
a computer far, far away on the net (topologically speaking; two
machines in the same room in Atlanta might route mail to one another
via a system in Chicago), a chap who wished to remain anonymous (but
who was eventually assigned the DoD membership #1) wrote a satire of
the various personalities and flame wars of rec.motorcycles, and
signed it "The Denizen of Doom". Not wishing to identify himself, he
asked that stalwart individual who would in the fullness of time
become DoD #2 to post it for him. DoD #2, not really giving a whit
about what other people thought and generally being a right thinking
individual, did so.  Flaming and other amusements followed. 

He who would become the holder of DoD membership #3 thought this was
the funniest thing he'd seen in a while (being the sort that is pretty
easily amused), so he claimed membership in the Denizens of Doom
Motorcycle Club, and started signing his postings with his membership
number. 

Perhaps readers of rec.motorcycles were struck with the vision of a
motorcycle club with no dues, no rules, no restrictions as to brand or
make or model or national origin of motorcycle, a club organized
electronically.  It may well be that readers were yearning to become a
part of something that would provide them with a greater identity, a
gestalt personality, something in which the whole was greater than the
sum of its parts.  It could also be that we're all computer nerds who
wear black socks and sneakers and pocket protectors, who just happen
to also love taking risks on machines with awesome power to weight
ratios, social outcasts who saw a clique that would finally be open
minded enough to accept us as members. 

In a clear case of self fulfilling prophesy, The Denizens of Doom
Motorcycle Club was born. A club in which the majority of members have
never met one another face to face (and perhaps like it that way), yet
feel that they know one another pretty well (or well enough given some
of the electronic personalities in the newsgroup). A club organized
and run (in the loosest sense of the word) by volunteers through the
network via electronic news and mail, with a membership/mailing list
(often used to organize group rides amongst members who live in the
same region), a motto, a logo, a series of photo albums circulating
around the country (organized by DoD #9), club patches (organized by
#11), and even an MTV-style music video (produced by #47 and
distributed on VHS by #18)! 

Where will it end? Who knows? Will the DoD start sanctioning races,
placing limits on the memory and clock rate of the on-board engine
management computers? Will the DoD organize poker runs where each
participant collects a hand of hardware and software reference cards?
Will the DoD have a rally in which the attendees demand a terminal
room and at least a 386-sized UNIX system? Only time will tell. 

The DoD has no dues, no rules, and no requirements other than net
access and a love for motorcycles. To become a member, one need only
ask (although we will admit that who you must ask is one of the few
really good club secrets). New members will receive via email a
membership number and the latest copy of the membership list, which
includes name, state, and email address. 

The Denizens of Doom Motorcycle Club will live forever (or at least
until next year when we may decided to change the name). 

                  Live to Flame - Flame to Live

                      The DoD

              by the Denizen of Doom    DoD #1
 
Welcome one and all to the flamingest, most wonderfullest newsgroup of
all time: wreck.mudder-disciples or is it reak.mudder-disciples? The
Names have been changes to protect the Guilty (riders) and Innocent
(the bikes) alike. If you think you recognize a contorted version of
your name, you don't. It's just your guilt complex working against
you. Read 'em and weep. 

We tune in on a conversation between some of our heros. Terrible
Barbarian is extolling the virtues of his Hopalonga Puff-a-cane to
Reverend Muck Mudgers and Stompin Fueling-Injection: 

Terrible: This Hopalonga is the greatest... Beats BMWs dead!! 

Muck: I don't mean to preach, Terrible, but lighten up on the BMW
     crowd eh?  I mean like I like riding my Yuka-yuka Fudgeo-Jammer
     11 but what the heck.  

Stompin: No way, the BMW is it, complete, that's all man.

Terrible: Nahhhh, you're sounding like Heritick Ratatnack! Hey, at
     least he is selling his BMW and uses a Hopalonga Intercorruptor!
     Not as good as a Puff-a-cane, should have been called a
     Woosh-a-stream.

Stompin: You mean Wee-Stream.

Terrible: Waddya going to do? Call in reinforcements???

Stompin: Yehh man. Here comes Arlow Scarecrow and High Tech. Let's see
     what they say, eh? 

Muck: Now men, let's try to be civil about this.

High Tech: Hi, I'm a 9 and the BMW is the greatest.

Arlow: Other than my B.T. I love my BMW!

Terrible: B.T.???

Arlow: Burley Thumpison, the greatest all American ride you can own.

Muck: Ahhh, look, you're making Terrible gag.

Terrible: What does BMW stand for anyway??? 

Muck, Arlow, High: Beats Me, Wilhelm.

Terrible: Actually, my name is Terrible. Hmmm, I don't know either.

Muck: Say, here comes Chunky Bear.

Chunky: Hey, Hey, Hey! Smarter than your average bear!

Terrible: Hey, didn't you drop your BMW???

Chunky: All right eh, a little BooBoo, but I left him behind. I mean 
     even Villy Ogle flamed me for that! 

Muck: It's okay, we all makes mistakes.

Out of the blue the West coasters arrive, led by Tread Orange with
Dill Snorkssy, Heritick Ratatnack, Buck Garnish, Snob Rasseller and
the perenial favorite: Hooter Boobin Brush! 

Heritick: Heya Terrible, how's yer front to back bias?

Terrible: Not bad, sold yer BMW?

Heritick: Nahhh.

Hooter: Hoot, Hoot.

Buck: Nice tree Hooter, how'd ya get up there?

Hooter: Carbujectors from Hell!!!

Muck: What's a carbujector?

Hooter: Well, it ain't made of alumican!!! Made by Tilloslert!!

Muck: Ahh, come on down, we aren't going to flame ya, honest!!

Dill: Well, where do we race?

Snob: You know, Chunky, we know about about your drop and well, don't
     ride! 

Muck: No! No! Quiet!

Tread: BMW's are the greatest in my supreme level headed opinion.
     They even have luggage made by Sourkraut!

High: My 9 too!

Terrible, Heritick, Dill, Buck: Nahhhhh!!!

Stompin, Tread, High, Chunky, Snob: Yesss Yessssss!!!

Before this issue could be resolved the Hopalonga crew called up more
cohorts from the local area including Polyanna Stirrup and the
infamous Booster Robiksen on his Cavortin! 

Polyanna: Well, men, the real bikers use stirrups on their bikes like
     I use on my Hopalonga Evening-Bird Special. Helpful for getting
     it up on the ole ventral stand!  

Terrible: Hopalonga's are great like Polyanna says and Yuka-Yuka's and
     Sumarikis and Kersnapis are good too! 

Booster: I hate Cavortin.

All: WE KNOW, WE KNOW.

Booster: I love Cavortin.

All: WE KNOW WE KNOW.

Muck: Well, what about Mucho Guzlers and Lepurras?

Snob, Tread: Nawwwwww.

Muck: What about a Tridump?

Terrible: Isn't that a chewing gum?

Muck: Auggggg, Waddda about a Pluck-a-kity?

Heritick: Heyya Muck, you tryin' to call up the demon rider himself?

Muck: No, no. There is more to Mudder-Disciples than arguing about make.

Two more riders zoom in, in the form of Pill Turret and Phalanx Lifter.
Pill: Out with dorsal stands and ventral stands forever.

Phalanx: Hey, I don't know about that.

And Now even more west coasters pour in.
Road O'Noblin: Hopalonga's are the greatest!

Maulled Beerstein: May you sit on a bikejector!

Suddenly more people arrived from the great dark nurth:
Kite Lanolin: Hey, BMW's are great, men.

Robo-Nickie: I prefer motorcycle to robot transformers, personally.

More riders from the west coast come into the discussion:
Aviator Sourgas: Get a Burley-Thumpison with a belted-rigged frame.

Guess Gasket: Go with a BMW or Burley-Thumpison.

With a roar and a screech the latest mudder-disciple thundered in. It
was none other that Clean Bikata on her Hopalonga CaBammerXorn. 
Clean: Like look, Hopalonga are it but only CaBammerXorns. 

Muck: Why??

Clean: Well, like it's gotta be a 6-banger or nothin.

Muck: But I only have a 4-banger.

Clean: No GOOD!

Chunky: Sob, some of us only have 2-bangers!

Clean: Inferior!

Stompin: Hey, look, here's proof BMW's are better. The Bimmer-Boys
burst into song: (singing) Beemer Babe, Beemer Babe give me a
thrill... 

Road, Terrible, Polyanna, Maulled, Dill etc.: Wadddoes BMW stand for? 

Heritick, Stompin, Snob, Chunky, Tread, Kite, High, Arlow: BEAT'S ME,
     WILHEM! 

Road, Terrible, Polyanna, Maulled, Dill etc.: Oh, don't you mean BMW? 

And so the ensuing argument goes until the skies clouded over and the
thunder roared and the Greatest Mudder-Disciple (G.M.D.) of them all
boomed out.
G.M.D.: Enough of your bickering! You are doomed to riding
     Bigot & Suction powered mini-trikes for your childish actions. 

All: no, No, NO!!! Puhlease.

Does this mean that all of the wreck.mudder-disciples will be riding
mini-trikes?  Are our arguing heros doomed?  Tune in next week for the
next gut wretching episode of "The Yearning and Riderless" with its
ever increasing cast of characters.  Where all technical problems will
be flamed over until well done.  Next week's episode will answer the
question of: "To Helmet or Not to Helmet" will be aired, this is heady
material and viewer discretion is advised.

          Script for the Denizens of Doom Anthem Video

                by Jonathan E. Quist   DoD #94


[Scene:  A sterile engineering office.  A lone figure, whom we'll call
Chuck, stands by a printer output bin, wearing a white CDC lab coat,
with 5 mechanical pencils in a pocket protector.] 

(editor's note: For some reason a great deal of amusement was had at
the First Annual DoD Uni-Coastal Ironhorse Ride & Joust by denizens
referring to each other as "Chuck". I guess you had to be there. I
wasn't.) 

Chuck:  I didn't want to be a Software Systems Analyst,
 cow-towing to the whims of a machine, and saying yessir, nosir,
 may-I-have-another-sir.  My mother made me do it.  I wanted
 to live a man's life,
[Music slowly builds in background]
 riding Nortons and Triumphs through the highest mountain passes
 and the deepest valleys,
 living the life of a Motorcyclist;
 doing donuts and evading the police;
 terrorizing old ladies and raping small children;
 eating small dogs for tea (and large dogs for dinner).  In short,

	I Want to be      A Denizen!

[Chuck rips off his lab coat, revealing black leather jacket (with
fringe), boots, and cap.  Scene simultaneously changes to the top of
an obviously assaulted Rollins Pass.  A small throng of Hell's Angels
sit on their Harleys in the near background, gunning their engines,
showering lookers-on with nails as they turn donuts, and leaking oil
on the tarmac.  Chuck is standing in front of a heavily chromed Fat
Boy.] 

Chuck [Sings to the tune of "The Lumberjack Song"]:

I'm a Denizen and I'm okay,
I flame all night and I ride all day.

[Hell's Angels Echo Chorus, surprisingly heavy on tenors]:
He's a Denizen and he's okay,
He flames all night and he rides all day.

I ride my bike;
I eat my lunch;
I go to the lavat'ry.
On Wednesdays I ride Skyline,
Running children down with glee.

[Chorus]:
He rides his bike;
He eats his lunch;
He goes to the lavat'ry.
On Wednesdays he rides Skyline,
Running children down with glee.

[Chorus refrain]:
'Cause He's a Denizen...

I ride real fast,
My name is Chuck,
It somehow seems to fit.
I over-rate the worst bad f*ck,
But like a real good sh*t.

Oh, I'm a Denizen and I'm okay!
I flame all night and I ride all day.

[Chorus refrain]:
Oh, He's a Denizen...

I wear high heels
And bright pink shorts,
 full leathers and a bra.
I wish I rode a Harley,
 just like my dear mama.

                    Why you have to be killed.

Well, the first thing you have to understand (just in case you managed
to read this far, and still not figure it out) is that the DoD started
as a joke. And in the words of one Denizen, it intends to remain one.

Sometime in the far distant past, a hapless newbie asked: "What does DoD
stand for? It's not the Department of Defense is it?" Naturally, a
Denizen who had watched the movie "Top Gun" a few times too many rose
to the occasion and replied:

"That's classified, we could tell you, but then we'd have to kill you."

And the rest is history.

A variation on the "security" theme is to supply disinformation about
what DoD stands for. Notable contributions (and contributers, where
known) include:

Daughters of Democracy (DoD 23)		Doers of Donuts
Dancers of Despair (DoD 9)		Debasers of Daughters
Dickweeds of Denver			Driveway of Death
Debauchers of Donuts			Dumpers of Dirtbikes

Note that this is not a comprehensive list, as variations appear to be
limited only by the contents of one's imagination or dictionary file.

                     The rec.moto.photo archive

First a bit of history, this all started with Ilana Stern and Chuck
Rogers organizing a rec.motorcycles photo album. Many copies were made,
and several sets were sent on tours around the world, only to vanish in
unknown locations. Then Bruce Tanner decided that it would be appropriate
for an electronic medium to have an electronic photo album. Bruce has not
only provided the disk space and ftp & e-mail access, but he has taken
the time to scan most of the photos that are available from the archive.

Not only can you see what all these folks look like, you can also gawk
at their motorcycles. A few non-photo files are available from the
server too, they include the DoD membership list, the DoD Yellow Pages,
the general rec.motorcycles FAQ, and this FAQ posting.

Here are a couple of excerpts from from messages Bruce posted about how
to use the archive.

**********************************************************

Via ftp:

cerritos.edu [130.150.200.21]

Via e-mail:

The address is server@cerritos.edu.  The commands are given in the body of the
message.  The current commands are DIR and SEND, given one per line.  The
arguments to the commands are VMS style file specifications.  For
rec.moto.photo the file spec is [DOD]file.  For example, you can send:

dir [dod]
send [dod]bruce_tanner.gif
send [dod]dodframe.ps

and you'll get back 5 mail messages; a directory listing, 3 uuencoded parts
of bruce_tanner.gif, and the dodframe.ps file in ASCII.

Oh, wildcards (*) are allowed, but a maximum of 20 mail messages (rounded up to
the next whole file) are send.  A 'send [dod]*.gif' would send 150 files of
50K each; not a good idea.

**********************************************************

A couple of comments: Bruce has put quite a bit of effort into this, so
why not drop him a note if you find the rec.moto.photo archive useful?
Second, since Bruce has provided the server as a favor, it would be kind
of you to access it after normal working hours (California time).

                      Patches? What patches?

You may have heard mention of various DoD trinkets such as patches &
pins. And your reaction was probably: "I want!", or "That's sick!", or
perhaps "That's sick! I want!"

Well, there's some good news and some bad news. The good news is that
there's been an amazing variety of DoD-labeled widgets created. The bad
news is that there isn't anywhere you can buy any of them. This isn't
because of any "exclusivity" attempt, but simply because there is no
"DoD store" that keeps a stock. All of the creations have been done by
individual Denizens out of their own pockets. The typical procedure is
someone says "I'm thinking of having a DoD frammitz made, they'll cost
$xx.xx, with $xx.xx going to the AMA museum. Anyone want one?" Then
orders are taken, and a batch of frammitzes large enough to cover the
pre-paid orders is produced (and quickly consumed). So if you want a
DoD doodad, act quickly the next time somebody decides to do one. Or
produce one yourself if you see a void that needs filling, after all
this is anarchy in action.

Here's a possibly incomplete list of known DoD merchandise (and
perpetrators). Patches (DoD#11), pins (DoD#99), stickers (DoD#99),
motorcycle license plate frames (DoD#216), t-shirts (DoD#99), polo shirts
(DoD#122), Zippo lighters (DoD#99) [LtF FtL], belt buckles (DoD#99), and
patches (DoD#99) [a second batch was done (and rapidly consumed) by
popular demand].

All "profits" have been donated to the American Motorcyclist Association
Motorcycle Heritage Museum. As of June 1992, over $5500 dollars has been
contributed to the museum fund by the DoD. If you visit the museum,
you'll see a large plaque on the Founders' Wall in the name of "Denizens
of Doom, USENET, The World", complete with a DoD pin.

Here's a letter from the AMA to the DoD regarding our contributions.

~Newsgroups: rec.motorcycles
~From: Arnie Skurow <arnie@magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu>
~Subject: A letter from the Motorcycle Heritage Museum
~Date: Mon, 13 Apr 1992 11:04:58 GMT

I received the following letter from Jim Rogers, director of the Museum,
the other day.

"Dear Arnie and all members of the Denizens of Doom:

Congratulations and expressions of gratitude are in order for you and the
Denizens of Doom!  With your recent donation, the total amount donated is
now $5,500.  On behalf of the AMHF, please extend my heartfeld gratitude
to all the membership of the Denizens.  The club's new plaque is presently
being prepared.  Of course, everyone is invited to come to the museum to 
see the plaque that will be installed in our Founders Foyer.  By the way,
I will personally mount a Denizens club pin on the plaque.  Again, thank 
you for all your support, which means so much to the foundation, the
museum, and the fulfillment of its goals.

                                Sincerely,

                                Director

P.S.  Please post on your computer bulletin board."

As you all know, even though the letter was addressed to me personally,
it was meant for all of you who purchased DoD goodies that made this
amount possible.

DoD contributions to the American Motorcyclist Association Motorcycle
Heritage Museum. Over $5500  [Arnie]
 
                        Organized (?) Rides:

Summer 1992 saw more organized rides, with the Joust in its third
year, and the Ride & Feed going strong, but without the Rollins Pass
trip due to the collapse of a tunnel.  The East Coast Denizens got
together for the Right Coast Ride (RCR), with bikers from as far north
as NH, and as far south as FL meeting in the Blueridge Mountains of
North Carolina.  The Pacific Northwest crew organized  the first Great
Pacific Northwest Dryside Gather (GPNDG), another successful excuse for
riding motorcycles, and seeing the faces behind the names we all have
come to know so well.  [Thanks to Ed Green for the above addition.]

Also worth mentioning are: The first rec.moto.dirt ride, held in the
Moab/Canyonlands area of southern Utah. Riders from 5 states showed up,
riding everything from monster BMWs to itty-bitty XRs to almost-legal
2-strokes.  And though it's not an "official" (as if anything could be
official with this crowd) rec.moto event, the vintage motorcycle races
in Steamboat Springs, Colorado always provides a good excuse for netters
to gather.  There's also been the occasional Labor Day gather in Utah.
European Denizens have staged some gathers too.  (Your ad here,
reasonable rates!)

	What used to peeve me in Canada was the cars with bloody _red_ rear
indicators.  You'd see a single red light come on and think, "Now, is he
stopping but one brake-lamp is not working, or does he have those dumb bloody
_red_ rear indicators?"  This being Survival 101, you have to assume he's
braking and take the appropriate actions, until such time as the light goes
out and on again, after which you can be reasonably certain it's a bloody _red_
rear indicator.

Suggest McQuires #1 plastic polish.  It will help somewhat but nothing 
will remove deep scratches without making it worse than it already is.
McQuires will do something for fine or light stuff.

Also suggest calling your local plastic shop.  In Calif. "TAP PLASTIC" is
a chain that carries most of what is needed for repair and sometimes
replacement of plastic bits.  Telephone in the Bay area is 415-962-8430.
I'm not sure how amenable they are to shipping.  I have found that they
have several excellent products for cleaning, and removing crap from
windscreens and face shields.  Also they have one called "lift-it" which
works real well in removing sticky stuffs such as adhessives from plastic
wihtout scratching same.

Luck,

You got off cheap.  My sister's ex-boyfriend was such an incessant pain
in the ass about wanting to ride my bikes (no way, Jose) that I
finally took him to Lindner's BMW in New Canaan, CT last fall where
I had seen a nice, used K100RS in perfect condition.  After telling
everyone in the shop his Norton war stories from fifteen years ago,
signing the liability waiver, and getting his pre-flight, off he went...

Well, not quite.  I walked out of a pizza shop up the street,
feeling good about myself (made my sister's boyfriend happy and got
the persistent wanker off my ass for good), heard the horrendous
racket of an engine tortured to its red line and then a crash.  I
saw people running towards the obvious source of the disturbance...
Jeff laying under the BMW with the rear wheel spinning wildly and
someone groping for the kill switch.  I stared in disbelief with
a slice hanging out of my mouth as Matty, the shop manager, slid
up beside me and asked, "Friend of yours, Steve?".  "Shit, Matty,
it could have been worse.  That could been my FLHS!"

Jeff hadn't made it 10 inches.  Witnesses said he lifted his feet
before letting out the clutch and gravity got the best of him.
Jeff claimed that the clutch didn't engage.  Matty was quick.
While Jeff was still stuttering in embarrassed shock he managed
to snatch Jeff's credit card for a quick imprint and signature.  Twenty
minutes later, when Jeff's color had paled to a flush, Matty
presented him with an estimate of $580 for a busted right mirror
and a hairline crack in the fairing.  That was for fixing the crack
and masking the damaged area, not a new fairing.  Or he could buy the
bike.

I'm not sure what happened later as my sister split up with Jeff shortly
afterwards (to hook up with another piece of work) except that Matty
told me he ran the charge through in December and that it went
uncontested.

at least twenty-five Harley riders.  I was leading a group of about four

Summary: OPCY is just too small...

Hell, the Orioles' Opening Day game could easily be the largest in history
if we had a stadium with 80,000 seats. But unfortunely the Yards (a
definitely excellent ballpark) only holds like 45,000 with 275 SRO spots.
Ticket sales for the entire year is moving fast. Bleacher seats are almost
gone for every game this year. It's a extremely likelyhood that the O's
could sell out every game this year (especially if we lead the division for
most of the year like '89). 
	On another front, the sale of the Orioles to anyone is likely to be
forced upon Eli Jacobs who is major debt apparently. Maybe we can get an
owner willing to spend on a proven rightfielder free agent in the winter.
	Fernando has made the O's as the fifth starter. The O's pitching
staff looks pretty good. Sutcliffe, Mussina, McDonald, Rhodes, and Fernando.
	Baltimore is my pick for the victors in a very competitive AL East.

I agree and disagree.  John is saying that the batters efforts will result
in 4 more wins then losses.  While you are probably correct that 400%
does not mean 4 more wins then losses, it means something.  I would
rather have a player who increased my teams chances of winning by 1% in
each of 400 PAs then I would a player who increased my chances of winning
by .5% in each of 400 PAs.  Thus, there appears to me to be an obvious
positive association between John's statistic and winning games.  Thus,
before you disregard this stat, it appears to me that further study must
go into what sort of relationship there is.

The only problem here is an insistance that these number mean exactly
how many wins the team has.  First, we are using averages over many
seasons and applying them to one game.  Second, remember some players
performance take away from the chance of you winning.  That is a
player who gets an out gets a "negative probability" in most cases.
Thus, I'm not sure in any given game when you add up all the numbers
for a team who won that they will add up to 1 in that game.  Sometimes,
they will add up to more then one sometime, less than one.  Also,
the pitchers' bad performances (giving up 6 runs) may have given
them a large negative percentage for that game.  Also, any batter that
pulled an 0-4 night would give large negatives.

No, but really only because you have a smaller sample size.  I would
think however, that the number of runs you score in the first inning
would be just as good as a prediction as how many runs you score 
in the last inning.  And, realize something else a closer usually
comes in in a close situation, not a blow out.  It is hard to argue
that any runs that a closer gives up in a game have equal importance
to those given up in the first inning.  Look, a closer giving up runs
often means a team will lose many games.  On, the other hand a starter
who gives up runs often still leaves his team a chance to win.  The
offence has many more outs to do something about.  But, I am not
saying all late inning situations are equally important either.  If
I am down 8 runs in the ninth, it really does not matter how many
runs my pitcher gives up in the ninth.

>Does this make sense?


No, but why would you assume that the teams probability of winning would
be 0 before the possesion in which the free throws were made.  Look,
if you are down 1 point with 5 seconds left, there is a fairly high
probability that you will win the game if you are in possesion of the
ball.  And, do not forget that somebody elses missed shots, turnovers,
fouls, bad defense, etc. caused a "negative chance" that the team
would win.
 
From reading all of the discussion on this statistic, I feel that those
who critisize it to a certain extent are doing so out of an agenda.
At first look this statistic valadates clutchness.  But, it really
does not.  Cluthness revolves around the idea that certain players
in crucial situation elevate their performance and others performance
goes down.  I've never seen convincing proof that this really happens.
So, if you assume there is no clutchness, then that means that except
for a lot of noice, this statistic has a positive association to
player performance.  There is a way to get rid of the noice if you
do not believe in clutchness.  Certainly, we could find out what
the average value of a home run is for example.  We may find for
instance, that a home run increases your chance of winning by 15%
on average while a strikeout decreases your chance of winning by 5%.
I bet if this were done we would find that this statistic was just
as good as other statistics we have for predicting wins and losses.

How do we evaluate relief pitchers?  Say John and Sam have the
exact same pitching statistics (runs, earned runs, K's, BB's,
etc.)  Both had exceptional numbers.  John, however only pitched
in closer situations, while Sam was a Mop up man.  Who was more
valuble to their team?  Probably John.  Who was the better 
pitcher?  They were probably about the same.

Summary: Earl Weaver Commandments

	The Orioles' pitching staff again is having a fine exhibition season.
Four shutouts, low team ERA, (Well, I haven't gotten any baseball news since
March 14 but anyways) Could they contend, yes. Could they win it all?  Maybe.

But for all those fans of teams with bad spring records, remember Earl
Weaver's first law of baseball (From his book on managing)

No one gives a damn in July if you lost a game in March. :)

BTW, anyone have any idea on the contenders for the O's fifth starter?
It's pretty much set that Sutcliffe, Mussina, McDonald and Rhodes are the
first four in the rotation.

Here at Johns Hopkins University where the mascot is the Blue Jay :(,
their baseball team logo was the Toronto club's logo. Now it's a 
anatomically correct blue jay. God, can't they think of an original idea?
It's even in the same pose as the baltimore oriole on the O's hats.
How many people realize that the bird is really called a baltimore oriole?

Summary: Root, root, root for the Orioles...

I heard that Eli is selling the team to a group in Cinninati. This would
help so that the O's could make some real free agent signings in the 
offseason. Training Camp reports that everything is pretty positive right
now. The backup catcher postion will be a showdown between Tackett and Parent
although I would prefer Parent. #1 Draft Pick Jeff Hammonds may be coming
up faster in the O's hierarchy of the minors faster than expected. Mike
Flanagan is trying for another comeback. Big Ben is being defended by
coaches saying that while the homers given up were an awful lot, most came
in the beginning of the season and he really improved the second half. This
may be Ben's year. 
	I feel that while this may not be Mussina's Cy Young year, he will
be able to pitch the entire season without periods of fatigue like last year
around August. I really hope Baines can provide the RF support the O's need.
Orsulak was decent but I had hoped that Chito Martinez could learn defense
better and play like he did in '91. The O's right now don't have many
left-handed hitters. Anderson proving last year was no fluke and Cal's return
to his averages would be big plusses in a drive for the pennant. The 
rotation should be Sutcliffe, Mussina, McDonald, Rhodes, ?????. Olson is an
interesting case. Will he strike out the side or load the bases and then get
three pop outs? You never know.
The way I see the AL East this year (with personal biases mixed in)
Baltimore
New York
Toronto
Milwaukee
Cleveland
Boston
Detroit
(The top 4 are the only true contenders in my mind. One of these 4 will
definitely win the division unless it snows in Hell/Maryland :). I feel
that this Baltimore's season to finally put everything together.)

Summary: 1992 EWB II Stats wanted

	Hello, my friends and I are running the Homewood Fantasy Baseball
League (pure fantasy baseball teams). Unfortunely, we are running the league
using Earl Weaver Baseball II with the Comm. Disk II and we need the stats
for the 1992 season. (Preferably the 1992 Major League Stat Disk) We have
the '92 total stats but EWB2 needs the split stats otherwise we have 200
inning games because the Comm. Disk turns total stats into vs. L's stats
unless you know both right and left -handed stats.

	So, if anyone has the EWB2 '92 Stat Disk please e-mail me!

It sounds to me like it's just SCREAMING OUT for parody.  Give a copy to your
friendly neighbourhood SubGenius preacher; with luck, he'll run it through the
mental mincer and hand you back an outrageously offensive and gut-bustingly
funny parody you can paste over the originals.

                               Books -- Fiction

THOMAS M. DISCH

"The Santa Claus Compromise"
Short story.  The ultimate proof that Santa exists.  All characters and 
events are fictitious.  Any similarity to living or dead gods -- uh, well...

WALTER M. MILLER, JR

"A Canticle for Leibowitz"
One gem in this post atomic doomsday novel is the monks who spent their lives
copying blueprints from "Saint Leibowitz", filling the sheets of paper with
ink and leaving white lines and letters.

EDGAR PANGBORN

"Davy"
Post atomic doomsday novel set in clerical states.  The church, for example,
forbids that anyone "produce, describe or use any substance containing...
atoms". 

PHILIP K. DICK

Philip K. Dick Dick wrote many philosophical and thought-provoking short 
stories and novels.  His stories are bizarre at times, but very approachable.
He wrote mainly SF, but he wrote about people, truth and religion rather than
technology.  Although he often believed that he had met some sort of God, he
remained sceptical.  Amongst his novels, the following are of some relevance:

"Galactic Pot-Healer"
A fallible alien deity summons a group of Earth craftsmen and women to a
remote planet to raise a giant cathedral from beneath the oceans.  When the
deity begins to demand faith from the earthers, pot-healer Joe Fernwright is
unable to comply.  A polished, ironic and amusing novel.

"A Maze of Death"
Noteworthy for its description of a technology-based religion.

"VALIS"
The schizophrenic hero searches for the hidden mysteries of Gnostic
Christianity after reality is fired into his brain by a pink laser beam of
unknown but possibly divine origin.  He is accompanied by his dogmatic and
dismissively atheist friend and assorted other odd characters.

"The Divine Invasion"
God invades Earth by making a young woman pregnant as she returns from
another star system.  Unfortunately she is terminally ill, and must be
assisted by a dead man whose brain is wired to 24-hour easy listening music.

MARGARET ATWOOD

"The Handmaid's Tale"
A story based on the premise that the US Congress is mysteriously
assassinated, and fundamentalists quickly take charge of the nation to set it
"right" again.  The book is the diary of a woman's life as she tries to live
under the new Christian theocracy.  Women's right to own property is revoked,
and their bank accounts are closed; sinful luxuries are outlawed, and the
radio is only used for readings from the Bible.  Crimes are punished
retroactively: doctors who performed legal abortions in the "old world" are
hunted down and hanged.  Atwood's writing style is difficult to get used to
at first, but the tale grows more and more chilling as it goes on.

VARIOUS AUTHORS

"The Bible"
This somewhat dull and rambling work has often been criticized.  However, it
is probably worth reading, if only so that you'll know what all the fuss is
about.  It exists in many different versions, so make sure you get the one
true version.

                             Books -- Non-fiction

PETER DE ROSA

"Vicars of Christ", Bantam Press, 1988
Although de Rosa seems to be Christian or even Catholic this is a very
enlighting history of papal immoralities, adulteries, fallacies etc.
(German translation: "Gottes erste Diener. Die dunkle Seite des Papsttums",
Droemer-Knaur, 1989)

MICHAEL MARTIN

"Atheism: A Philosophical Justification", Temple University Press,
 Philadelphia, USA.
A detailed and scholarly justification of atheism.  Contains an outstanding
appendix defining terminology and usage in this (necessarily) tendentious
area.  Argues both for "negative atheism" (i.e. the "non-belief in the
existence of god(s)") and also for "positive atheism" ("the belief in the
non-existence of god(s)").  Includes great refutations of the most
challenging arguments for god; particular attention is paid to refuting
contempory theists such as Platinga and Swinburne.
541 pages. ISBN 0-87722-642-3 (hardcover; paperback also available)

"The Case Against Christianity", Temple University Press
A comprehensive critique of Christianity, in which he considers
the best contemporary defences of Christianity and (ultimately)

Subtitled "The Origins of Unbelief in America".  Examines the way in which
unbelief (whether agnostic or atheistic)  became a mainstream alternative
world-view.  Focusses on the period 1770-1900, and while considering France

RICHARD SWINBURNE

"The Existence of God (Revised Edition)", Clarendon Paperbacks, Oxford
This book is the second volume in a trilogy that began with "The Coherence of
Theism" (1977) and was concluded with "Faith and Reason" (1981).  In this
work, Swinburne attempts to construct a series of inductive arguments for the
existence of God.  His arguments, which are somewhat tendentious and rely
upon the imputation of late 20th century western Christian values and
aesthetics to a God which is supposedly as simple as can be conceived, were
decisively rejected in Mackie's "The Miracle of Theism".  In the revised
edition of "The Existence of God", Swinburne includes an Appendix in which he
makes a somewhat incoherent attempt to rebut Mackie.

J. L. MACKIE

"The Miracle of Theism", Oxford
This (posthumous) volume contains a comprehensive review of the principal
arguments for and against the existence of God.  It ranges from the classical
philosophical positions of Descartes, Anselm, Berkeley, Hume et al, through
the moral arguments of Newman, Kant and Sidgwick, to the recent restatements
of the classical theses by Plantinga and Swinburne.  It also addresses those
positions which push the concept of God beyond the realm of the rational,
such as those of Kierkegaard, Kung and Philips, as well as "replacements for
God" such as Lelie's axiarchism.  The book is a delight to read - less
formalistic and better written than Martin's works, and refreshingly direct
when compared with the hand-waving of Swinburne.

                          An Introduction to Atheism
                       by mathew <mathew@mantis.co.uk>

This article attempts to provide a general introduction to atheism.  Whilst I
have tried to be as neutral as possible regarding contentious issues, you
should always remember that this document represents only one viewpoint.  I
would encourage you to read widely and draw your own conclusions; some
relevant books are listed in a companion article.

To provide a sense of cohesion and progression, I have presented this article
as an imaginary conversation between an atheist and a theist.  All the
questions asked by the imaginary theist are questions which have been cropped
up repeatedly on alt.atheism since the newsgroup was created.  Some other
frequently asked questions are answered in a companion article.

Please note that this article is arguably slanted towards answering questions
posed from a Christian viewpoint.  This is because the FAQ files reflect
questions which have actually been asked, and it is predominantly Christians
who proselytize on alt.atheism.

So when I talk of religion, I am talking primarily about religions such as
Christianity, Judaism and Islam, which involve some sort of superhuman divine
being.  Much of the discussion will apply to other religions, but some of it
may not.

"What is atheism?"

Atheism is characterized by an absence of belief in the existence of God.
Some atheists go further, and believe that God does not exist.  The former is
often referred to as the "weak atheist" position, and the latter as "strong
atheism".

It is important to note the difference between these two positions.  "Weak
atheism" is simple scepticism; disbelief in the existence of God.  "Strong
atheism" is a positive belief that God does not exist.  Please do not
fall into the trap of assuming that all atheists are "strong atheists".

Some atheists believe in the non-existence of all Gods; others limit their
atheism to specific Gods, such as the Christian God, rather than making
flat-out denials.

"But isn't disbelieving in God the same thing as believing he doesn't exist?"

Definitely not.  Disbelief in a proposition means that one does not believe
it to be true.  Not believing that something is true is not equivalent to
believing that it is false; one may simply have no idea whether it is true or
not.  Which brings us to agnosticism.

"What is agnosticism then?"

The term 'agnosticism' was coined by Professor Huxley at a meeting of the
Metaphysical Society in 1876.  He defined an agnostic as someone who
disclaimed ("strong") atheism and believed that the ultimate origin of things
must be some cause unknown and unknowable.

Thus an agnostic is someone who believes that we do not and cannot know for
sure whether God exists.

Words are slippery things, and language is inexact.  Beware of assuming that
you can work out someone's philosophical point of view simply from the fact
that she calls herself an atheist or an agnostic.  For example, many people
use agnosticism to mean "weak atheism", and use the word "atheism" only when
referring to "strong atheism".

Beware also that because the word "atheist" has so many shades of meaning, it
is very difficult to generalize about atheists.  About all you can say for
sure is that atheists don't believe in God.  For example, it certainly isn't
the case that all atheists believe that science is the best way to find out
about the universe.

"So what is the philosophical justification or basis for atheism?"

There are many philosophical justifications for atheism.  To find out why a
particular person chooses to be an atheist, it's best to ask her.

Many atheists feel that the idea of God as presented by the major religions
is essentially self-contradictory, and that it is logically impossible that
such a God could exist.  Others are atheists through scepticism, because they
see no evidence that God exists.

"But isn't it impossible to prove the non-existence of something?"

There are many counter-examples to such a statement.  For example, it is
quite simple to prove that there does not exist a prime number larger than
all other prime numbers.  Of course, this deals with well-defined objects
obeying well-defined rules.  Whether Gods or universes are similarly
well-defined is a matter for debate.

However, assuming for the moment that the existence of a God is not provably
impossible, there are still subtle reasons for assuming the non-existence of
God.  If we assume that something does not exist, it is always possible to
show that this assumption is invalid by finding a single counter-example.

If on the other hand we assume that something does exist, and if the thing in
question is not provably impossible, showing that the assumption is invalid
may require an exhaustive search of all possible places where such a thing
might be found, to show that it isn't there.  Such an exhaustive search is
often impractical or impossible.  There is no such problem with largest
primes, because we can prove that they don't exist.

Therefore it is generally accepted that we must assume things do not exist
unless we have evidence that they do.  Even theists follow this rule most of
the time; they don't believe in unicorns, even though they can't conclusively
prove that no unicorns exist anywhere.

To assume that God exists is to make an assumption which probably cannot be
tested.  We cannot make an exhaustive search of everywhere God might be to
prove that he doesn't exist anywhere.  So the sceptical atheist assumes by
default that God does not exist, since that is an assumption we can test.

Those who profess strong atheism usually do not claim that no sort of God
exists; instead, they generally restrict their claims so as to cover
varieties of God described by followers of various religions.  So whilst it
may be impossible to prove conclusively that no God exists, it may be
possible to prove that (say) a God as described by a particular religious
book does not exist.  It may even be possible to prove that no God described
by any present-day religion exists.

In practice, believing that no God described by any religion exists is very
close to believing that no God exists.  However, it is sufficiently different
that counter-arguments based on the impossibility of disproving every kind of
God are not really applicable.

"But what if God is essentially non-detectable?"

If God interacts with our universe in any way, the effects of his interaction
must be measurable.  Hence his interaction with our universe must be
detectable.

If God is essentially non-detectable, it must therefore be the case that he
does not interact with our universe in any way.  Many atheists would argue
that if God does not interact with our universe at all, it is of no
importance whether he exists or not.

If the Bible is to be believed, God was easily detectable by the Israelites.
Surely he should still be detectable today?

Note that I am not demanding that God interact in a scientifically
verifiable, physical way.  It must surely be possible to perceive some
effect caused by his presence, though; otherwise, how can I distinguish him
from all the other things that don't exist?

"OK, you may think there's a philosophical justification for atheism, but
 isn't it still a religious belief?"

One of the most common pastimes in philosophical discussion is "the
redefinition game".  The cynical view of this game is as follows:

Person A begins by making a contentious statement.  When person B points out
that it can't be true, person A gradually re-defines the words he used in the
statement until he arrives at something person B is prepared to accept.  He
then records the statement, along with the fact that person B has agreed to
it, and continues.  Eventually A uses the statement as an "agreed fact", but
uses his original definitions of all the words in it rather than the obscure
redefinitions originally needed to get B to agree to it.  Rather than be seen
to be apparently inconsistent, B will tend to play along.

The point of this digression is that the answer to the question "Isn't
atheism a religious belief?" depends crucially upon what is meant by
"religious".  "Religion" is generally characterized by belief in a superhuman
controlling power -- especially in some sort of God -- and by faith and
worship.

[ It's worth pointing out in passing that some varieties of Buddhism are not
  "religion" according to such a definition. ]

Atheism is certainly not a belief in any sort of superhuman power, nor is it
categorized by worship in any meaningful sense.  Widening the definition of
"religious" to encompass atheism tends to result in many other aspects of
human behaviour suddenly becoming classed as "religious" as well -- such as
science, politics, and watching TV.

"OK, so it's not a religion.  But surely belief in atheism (or science) is
 still just an act of faith, like religion is?"

Firstly, it's not entirely clear that sceptical atheism is something one
actually believes in.

Secondly, it is necessary to adopt a number of core beliefs or assumptions to
make some sort of sense out of the sensory data we experience.  Most atheists
try to adopt as few core beliefs as possible; and even those are subject to
questioning if experience throws them into doubt.

Science has a number of core assumptions.  For example, it is generally
assumed that the laws of physics are the same for all observers.  These are
the sort of core assumptions atheists make.  If such basic ideas are called
"acts of faith", then almost everything we know must be said to be based on
acts of faith, and the term loses its meaning.

Faith is more often used to refer to complete, certain belief in something.
According to such a definition, atheism and science are certainly not acts of
faith.  Of course, individual atheists or scientists can be as dogmatic as
religious followers when claiming that something is "certain".  This is not a
general tendency, however; there are many atheists who would be reluctant to
state with certainty that the universe exists.

Faith is also used to refer to belief without supporting evidence or proof.
Sceptical atheism certainly doesn't fit that definition, as sceptical atheism
has no beliefs.  Strong atheism is closer, but still doesn't really match, as
even the most dogmatic atheist will tend to refer to experimental data (or
the lack of it) when asserting that God does not exist.

"If atheism is not religious, surely it's anti-religious?"

It is an unfortunate human tendency to label everyone as either "for" or
"against", "friend" or "enemy".  The truth is not so clear-cut.

Atheism is the position that runs logically counter to theism; in that sense,
it can be said to be "anti-religion".  However, when religious believers
speak of atheists being "anti-religious" they usually mean that the atheists
have some sort of antipathy or hatred towards theists.

This categorization of atheists as hostile towards religion is quite unfair.
Atheist attitudes towards theists in fact cover a broad spectrum.

Most atheists take a "live and let live" attitude.  Unless questioned, they
will not usually mention their atheism, except perhaps to close friends.  Of
course, this may be in part because atheism is not "socially acceptable" in
many countries.

A few atheists are quite anti-religious, and may even try to "convert" others
when possible.  Historically, such anti-religious atheists have made little
impact on society outside the Eastern Bloc countries.

(To digress slightly: the Soviet Union was originally dedicated to separation
of church and state, just like the USA.  Soviet citizens were legally free to
worship as they wished.  The institution of "state atheism" came about when
Stalin took control of the Soviet Union and tried to destroy the churches in
order to gain complete power over the population.)

Some atheists are quite vocal about their beliefs, but only where they see
religion encroaching on matters which are not its business -- for example,
the government of the USA.  Such individuals are usually concerned that
church and state should remain separate.

"But if you don't allow religion to have a say in the running of the state,
 surely that's the same as state atheism?"

The principle of the separation of church and state is that the state shall
not legislate concerning matters of religious belief.  In particular, it
means not only that the state cannot promote one religion at the expense of
another, but also that it cannot promote any belief which is religious in
nature.

Religions can still have a say in discussion of purely secular matters.  For
example, religious believers have historically been responsible for
encouraging many political reforms.  Even today, many organizations
campaigning for an increase in spending on foreign aid are founded as
religious campaigns.  So long as they campaign concerning secular matters,
and so long as they do not discriminate on religious grounds, most atheists
are quite happy to see them have their say.

"What about prayer in schools? If there's no God, why do you care if people
 pray?"

Because people who do pray are voters and lawmakers, and tend to do things
that those who don't pray can't just ignore.  Also, Christian prayer in
schools is intimidating to non-Christians, even if they are told that they
need not join in.  The diversity of religious and non-religious belief means
that it is impossible to formulate a meaningful prayer that will be
acceptable to all those present at any public event.

Also, non-prayers tend to have friends and family who pray.  It is reasonable
to care about friends and family wasting their time, even without other
motives.

"You mentioned Christians who campaign for increased foreign aid.  What about
 atheists?  Why aren't there any atheist charities or hospitals?  Don't
 atheists object to the religious charities?"

There are many charities without religious purpose that atheists can
contribute to.  Some atheists contribute to religious charities as well, for
the sake of the practical good they do.  Some atheists even do voluntary work
for charities founded on a theistic basis.

Most atheists seem to feel that atheism isn't worth shouting about in
connection with charity.  To them, atheism is just a simple, obvious everyday
matter, and so is charity.  Many feel that it's somewhat cheap, not to say
self-righteous, to use simple charity as an excuse to plug a particular set
of religious beliefs.

To "weak" atheists, building a hospital to say "I do not believe in God" is a
rather strange idea; it's rather like holding a party to say "Today is not my
birthday".  Why the fuss?  Atheism is rarely evangelical.

"You said atheism isn't anti-religious.  But is it perhaps a backlash against
 one's upbringing, a way of rebelling?"

Perhaps it is, for some.  But many people have parents who do not attempt to
force any religious (or atheist) ideas upon them, and many of those people
choose to call themselves atheists.

It's also doubtless the case that some religious people chose religion as a
backlash against an atheist upbringing, as a way of being different.  On the
other hand, many people choose religion as a way of conforming to the
expectations of others.

On the whole, we can't conclude much about whether atheism or religion are
backlash or conformism; although in general, people have a tendency to go
along with a group rather than act or think independently.

"How do atheists differ from religious people?"

They don't believe in God.  That's all there is to it.

Atheists may listen to heavy metal -- backwards, even -- or they may prefer a
Verdi Requiem, even if they know the words.  They may wear Hawaiian shirts,
they may dress all in black, they may even wear orange robes.  (Many
Buddhists lack a belief in any sort of God.)  Some atheists even carry a copy
of the Bible around -- for arguing against, of course!

Whoever you are, the chances are you have met several atheists without
realising it.  Atheists are usually unexceptional in behaviour and
appearance.

"Unexceptional? But aren't atheists less moral than religious people?"

That depends.  If you define morality as obedience to God, then of course
atheists are less moral as they don't obey any God.  But usually when one
talks of morality, one talks of what is acceptable ("right") and unacceptable
("wrong") behaviour within society.

Humans are social animals, and to be maximally successful they must
co-operate with each other.  This is a good enough reason to discourage most
atheists from "anti-social" or "immoral" behaviour, purely for the purposes
of self-preservation.

Many atheists behave in a "moral" or "compassionate" way simply because they
feel a natural tendency to empathize with other humans.  So why do they care
what happens to others?  They don't know, they simply are that way.

Naturally, there are some people who behave "immorally" and try to use
atheism to justify their actions.  However, there are equally many people who
behave "immorally" and then try to use religious beliefs to justify their
actions.  For example:

  "Here is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance: Jesus Christ
   came into the world to save sinners...  But for that very reason, I was
   shown mercy so that in me...  Jesus Christ might display His unlimited
   patience as an example for those who would believe in him and receive
   eternal life.  Now to the king eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God,
   be honor and glory forever and ever."

The above quote is from a statement made to the court on February 17th 1992
by Jeffrey Dahmer, the notorious cannibal serial killer of Milwaukee,
Wisconsin.  It seems that for every atheist mass-murderer, there is a
religious mass-murderer.  But what of more trivial morality?

   A survey conducted by the Roper Organization found that behavior
   deteriorated after "born again" experiences.  While only 4% of respondents
   said they had driven intoxicated before being "born again," 12% had done
   so after conversion.  Similarly, 5% had used illegal drugs before
   conversion, 9% after.  Two percent admitted to engaging in illicit sex
   before salvation; 5% after.
                                ["Freethought Today", September 1991, p. 12.]

So it seems that at best, religion does not have a monopoly on moral
behaviour.

"Is there such a thing as atheist morality?"

If you mean "Is there such a thing as morality for atheists?", then the
answer is yes, as explained above.  Many atheists have ideas about morality
which are at least as strong as those held by religious people.

If you mean "Does atheism have a characteristic moral code?", then the answer
is no.  Atheism by itself does not imply anything much about how a person
will behave.  Most atheists follow many of the same "moral rules" as theists,
but for different reasons.  Atheists view morality as something created by
humans, according to the way humans feel the world 'ought' to work, rather
than seeing it as a set of rules decreed by a supernatural being.

"Then aren't atheists just theists who are denying God?"

A study by the Freedom From Religion Foundation found that over 90% of the
atheists who responded became atheists because religion did not work for
them.  They had found that religious beliefs were fundamentally incompatible
with what they observed around them.

Atheists are not unbelievers through ignorance or denial; they are
unbelievers through choice.  The vast majority of them have spent time
studying one or more religions, sometimes in very great depth.  They have
made a careful and considered decision to reject religious beliefs.

This decision may, of course, be an inevitable consequence of that
individual's personality.  For a naturally sceptical person, the choice
of atheism is often the only one that makes sense, and hence the only
choice that person can honestly make.

"But don't atheists want to believe in God?"

Atheists live their lives as though there is nobody watching over them.  Many
of them have no desire to be watched over, no matter how good-natured the
"Big Brother" figure might be.

Some atheists would like to be able to believe in God -- but so what? Should
one believe things merely because one wants them to be true?  The risks of
such an approach should be obvious.  Atheists often decide that wanting to
believe something is not enough; there must be evidence for the belief.

"But of course atheists see no evidence for the existence of God -- they are
 unwilling in their souls to see!"

Many, if not most atheists were previously religious.  As has been explained
above, the vast majority have seriously considered the possibility that God
exists.  Many atheists have spent time in prayer trying to reach God.

Of course, it is true that some atheists lack an open mind; but assuming that
all atheists are biased and insincere is offensive and closed-minded.
Comments such as "Of course God is there, you just aren't looking properly"
are likely to be viewed as patronizing.

Certainly, if you wish to engage in philosophical debate with atheists it is
vital that you give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that they are
being sincere if they say that they have searched for God.  If you are not
willing to believe that they are basically telling the truth, debate is
futile.

"Isn't the whole of life completely pointless to an atheist?"

Many atheists live a purposeful life.  They decide what they think gives
meaning to life, and they pursue those goals.  They try to make their lives
count, not by wishing for eternal life, but by having an influence on other
people who will live on.  For example, an atheist may dedicate his life to
political reform, in the hope of leaving his mark on history.

It is a natural human tendency to look for "meaning" or "purpose" in random
events.  However, it is by no means obvious that "life" is the sort of thing
that has a "meaning".

To put it another way, not everything which looks like a question is actually
a sensible thing to ask.  Some atheists believe that asking "What is the
meaning of life?" is as silly as asking "What is the meaning of a cup of
coffee?".  They believe that life has no purpose or meaning, it just is.

"So how do atheists find comfort in time of danger?"

There are many ways of obtaining comfort; from family, friends, or even pets.
Or on a less spiritual level, from food or drink or TV.

That may sound rather an empty and vulnerable way to face danger, but so
what?  Should individuals believe in things because they are comforting, or
should they face reality no matter how harsh it might be?

In the end, it's a decision for the individual concerned.  Most atheists are
unable to believe something they would not otherwise believe merely because
it makes them feel comfortable.  They put truth before comfort, and consider
that if searching for truth sometimes makes them feel unhappy, that's just
hard luck.

"Don't atheists worry that they might suddenly be shown to be wrong?"

The short answer is "No, do you?"

Many atheists have been atheists for years.  They have encountered many
arguments and much supposed evidence for the existence of God, but they have
found all of it to be invalid or inconclusive.

Thousands of years of religious belief haven't resulted in any good proof of
the existence of God.  Atheists therefore tend to feel that they are unlikely
to be proved wrong in the immediate future, and they stop worrying about it.

"So why should theists question their beliefs? Don't the same arguments
 apply?"

No, because the beliefs being questioned are not similar.  Weak atheism is
the sceptical "default position" to take; it asserts nothing.  Strong atheism
is a negative belief.  Theism is a very strong positive belief.

Atheists sometimes also argue that theists should question their beliefs
because of the very real harm they can cause -- not just to the believers,
but to everyone else.

"What sort of harm?"

Religion represents a huge financial and work burden on mankind.  It's not
just a matter of religious believers wasting their money on church buildings;
think of all the time and effort spent building churches, praying, and so on.
Imagine how that effort could be better spent.

Many theists believe in miracle healing.  There have been plenty of instances
of ill people being "healed" by a priest, ceasing to take the medicines
prescribed to them by doctors, and dying as a result.  Some theists have died
because they have refused blood transfusions on religious grounds.

It is arguable that the Catholic Church's opposition to birth control -- and
condoms in particular -- is increasing the problem of overpopulation in many
third-world countries and contributing to the spread of AIDS world-wide.

Religious believers have been known to murder their children rather than
allow their children to become atheists or marry someone of a different
religion.

"Those weren't REAL believers.  They just claimed to be believers as some
 sort of excuse."

What makes a real believer?  There are so many One True Religions it's hard
to tell.  Look at Christianity: there are many competing groups, all
convinced that they are the only true Christians.  Sometimes they even fight
and kill each other.  How is an atheist supposed to decide who's a REAL
Christian and who isn't, when even the major Christian churches like the
Catholic Church and the Church of England can't decide amongst themselves?

In the end, most atheists take a pragmatic view, and decide that anyone who
calls himself a Christian, and uses Christian belief or dogma to justify his
actions, should be considered a Christian.  Maybe some of those Christians
are just perverting Christian teaching for their own ends -- but surely if
the Bible can be so readily used to support un-Christian acts it can't be
much of a moral code? If the Bible is the word of God, why couldn't he have
made it less easy to misinterpret? And how do you know that your beliefs
aren't a perversion of what your God intended?

If there is no single unambiguous interpretation of the Bible, then why
should an atheist take one interpretation over another just on your say-so?
Sorry, but if someone claims that he believes in Jesus and that he murdered
others because Jesus and the Bible told him to do so, we must call him a
Christian.

"Obviously those extreme sorts of beliefs should be questioned.  But since
 nobody has ever proved that God does not exist, it must be very unlikely
 that more basic religious beliefs, shared by all faiths, are nonsense."

That does not hold, because as was pointed out at the start of this dialogue,
positive assertions concerning the existence of entities are inherently much
harder to disprove than negative ones.  Nobody has ever proved that unicorns
don't exist, but that doesn't make it unlikely that they are myths.

It is therefore much more valid to hold a negative assertion by default than
it is to hold a positive assertion by default.  Of course, "weak" atheists
would argue that asserting nothing is better still.

"Well, if atheism's so great, why are there so many theists?"

Unfortunately, the popularity of a belief has little to do with how "correct"
it is, or whether it "works"; consider how many people believe in astrology,
graphology, and other pseudo-sciences.

Many atheists feel that it is simply a human weakness to want to believe in
gods.  Certainly in many primitive human societies, religion allows the
people to deal with phenomena that they do not adequately understand.

Of course, there's more to religion than that.  In the industrialized world,
we find people believing in religious explanations of phenomena even when
there are perfectly adequate natural explanations.  Religion may have started
as a means of attempting to explain the world, but nowadays it serves other
purposes as well.

"But so many cultures have developed religions.  Surely that must say
 something?"

Not really.  Most religions are only superficially similar; for example, it's
worth remembering that religions such as Buddhism and Taoism lack any sort of
concept of God in the Christian sense.

Of course, most religions are quick to denounce competing religions, so it's
rather odd to use one religion to try and justify another.

"What about all the famous scientists and philosophers who have concluded
 that God exists?"

For every scientist or philosopher who believes in a god, there is one who
does not.  Besides, as has already been pointed out, the truth of a belief is
not determined by how many people believe it.  Also, it is important to
realize that atheists do not view famous scientists or philosophers in the
same way that theists view their religious leaders.

A famous scientist is only human; she may be an expert in some fields, but
when she talks about other matters her words carry no special weight.  Many
respected scientists have made themselves look foolish by speaking on
subjects which lie outside their fields of expertise.

"So are you really saying that widespread belief in religion indicates
 nothing?"

Not entirely.  It certainly indicates that the religion in question has
properties which have helped it so spread so far.

The theory of memetics talks of "memes" -- sets of ideas which can propagate
themselves between human minds, by analogy with genes.  Some atheists view
religions as sets of particularly successful parasitic memes, which spread by
encouraging their hosts to convert others.  Some memes avoid destruction by
discouraging believers from questioning doctrine, or by using peer pressure
to keep one-time believers from admitting that they were mistaken.  Some
religious memes even encourage their hosts to destroy hosts controlled by
other memes.

Of course, in the memetic view there is no particular virtue associated with
successful propagation of a meme.  Religion is not a good thing because of
the number of people who believe it, any more than a disease is a good thing
because of the number of people who have caught it.

"Even if religion is not entirely true, at least it puts across important
 messages.  What are the fundamental messages of atheism?"

There are many important ideas atheists promote.  The following are just a
few of them; don't be surprised to see ideas which are also present in some
religions.

   There is more to moral behaviour than mindlessly following rules.

   Be especially sceptical of positive claims.

   If you want your life to have some sort of meaning, it's up to you to
   find it.

   Search for what is true, even if it makes you uncomfortable.

   Make the most of your life, as it's probably the only one you'll have.

   It's no good relying on some external power to change you; you must change
   yourself.

   Just because something's popular doesn't mean it's good.

   If you must assume something, assume something it's easy to test.

   Don't believe things just because you want them to be true.

and finally (and most importantly):

   All beliefs should be open to question.

Thanks for taking the time to read this article.

The argument goes as follows: Q-oid quotes appear in John, but not in
the almost codified way they were in Matthew or Luke. However, they are
considered to be similar enough to point to knowledge of Q as such, and
not an entirely different source.

We are talking date of texts here, not the age of the authors. The usual
explanation for the time order of Mark, Matthew and Luke does not consider
their respective ages. It says Matthew has read the text of Mark, and Luke
that of Matthew (and probably that of Mark).
 
As it is assumed that John knew the content of Luke's text. The evidence
for that is not overwhelming, admittedly.

When they are from about 200, why do they shed doubt on the order on

That John was a disciple is not generally accepted. The style and language
together with the theology are usually used as counterargument.
 
The argument that John was a disciple relies on the claim in the gospel
of John itself. Is there any other evidence for it?
 
One step and one generation removed is bad even in our times. Compare that
to reports of similar events in our century in almost illiterate societies.
Not even to speak off that believers are not necessarily the best sources.

In other words, one does not know what the original of Mark did look like
and arguments based on Mark are pretty weak.
 
But how is that connected to a redating of John?

Open letter by Dr. Paul H. Blackman, Research Coordinator for
NRA-ILA. NRA Official Journal 1/89.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Dear sir:

By now, we are used to the New England Journal of Medicine's publication
of small-scale studies related to firearms from which conclusions are
drawn which are quantum leaps from the data, followed by announcements of 
momentus "scientific" findings. These are regularly released to the press
without the caveats which riddle the conclusory paragraphs, and
often accompanied by an editorial calling attention to the findings.
Generally, while they at least present a few interesting data, however
meaningless, the studies misinterpret statistics, and ignore or belittle
serious studies by criminologists.

The latest effort -- "Handgun Regulations, Crime, Assaults, and Homicide:
A Tale of Two Cities," by J.H. Sloan, et al., with the accompanying 
editorial, "Firearms Injuries: A Call for Science," by two employees
of the Centers for Disease Control (November 10), however, is an insult
to the intelligence of any serious scholar in any field and have so few
data and so many flaws that I feel compelled to write at some length
to call attention to various major and minor failings, in no particular
order.

	1. The authors misleadingly cite Wright, et al. (Ref. 1) to 
	support the statement that "some have argued that restricting
	access to handguns could substantially reduce our annual rate
	of homicide." Wright, et al., in fact studied and rejected that
	contention.
	
	2. The authors pretended that Vancouver and Seattle are very
	similar cities with similar economic circumstances, histories,
	demographic characteristics, and the like. In fact, the cities
	are very different with very different demographic characteristics
	which appear to explain completely the higher homicide rate in
	Seattle. Both cities are over three-forths non-Hispanic white
	and *the non-Hispanic white homicide rates are reported to be
	the same in Seattle and Vancouver*. It is the different back-
	grounds, problems, circumstances, and behaviors of the various
	ethnic minorities which explain the difference in homicide.
	
	3. The authors pretend they are evaluating Canada's gun law,
	compared to Washington State's. But they do not examine at all
	the situation in Vancouver prior to the gun law taking effect
	in 1978. As it happens, in the three years prior to that (1975-
	1977), Vancouver averaged 23 homicides per year, one-eighth
	involving handguns, (Ref. 2) and in the seven years of the NEJM
	article there were 29 homicides per year, one-eigth involving
	handguns. Surely even the medical profession recognizes that
	one must look to see the prior situation was before concluding
	that a change made a difference? Would a physician conclude that
	a patient was benefiting from eating oat bran muffin each day
	for seven years because his cholesterol level was 200 without
	at least seeing if it was 180 before he started the regimen?
	
	4. The authors pick two medium-sized cities to evaluate a national
	gun law. Nothing can be learned from such a tiny and arbitrarily
	selected sample. Seattle appears to have been selected because
	it was convienient for the authors rather than for any scientific
	reason. Would physicians call something a scientific study which
	involved one experimental subject and one dissimilar "control"?
	Had different arbitrarily selected cities been chosen, opposite
	"scientific" conclusions would follow: Vancouver's homicide
	rate *exceeds* that of such "wild west" cities in Texas as
	El Paso, Corpus Christi, Austen, and, in Colorado, Colorado
	Springs. (Ref. 3)
	
	5. The authors fail to clearly demonstrate that firearms or
	handguns "are far more commonly owned in Seattle than in
	Vancouver." They use two surrogate approaches in pretending
	to study the availability of firearms/handguns. The first is
	an apples-and-oranges effort to compare the number of carry
	permits in Seattle to the number of registered handguns in
	Vancouver. But the number clearly understates the number of
	handguns in Seattle, and counts primarily *protective* handgun
	owners. The second, however, tells nothing about the number
	of handguns in Vancouver, and counts *non-protective* handguns
	for the most part. Where is it difficult to obtain handguns
	legally for protection, registration figures are
	meaningless. There are 66,000 registered handguns in New York
	City (New York Daily News, Sept. 27, 1987). Comparing the two,
	that method suggests about 930 handguns per 100,000 population
	in New York City compared to 960 in Vancouver, meaning Vancouver
	has a greater "prevalence of weapons" than New York City.
	
	The second method of measuring gun density is "Cook's gun
	prevalence index, a previously validated measure of intercity
	differences." But the validation was by Cook of his own
	theory. (Ref. 4) Normally, second opinions are sought from a
	different doctor. More significantly, the Cook index is
	based on the average of the percentage of firearms involvement
	in suicide and homicide. So the authors are basically taking
	a measure of misuse. Unsurprisingly, gun misuse in homicide
	(42% in Seattle, 14% in Vancouver) is related to gun misuse in
	homicide plus suicide, divided by two (41% in Seattle, 12% in
	Vancouver). The authors are not measuring the relative avail-
	ability of firearms, or of handguns, in Seattle and
	Vancouver.
	
	6. The authors misstate the laws of both Washington and
	Canada. They neglect to mention the significant fact that
	Washington has a waiting period and background check prior to
	the purchase of a handgun, and that provisions exist in Canadian
	law for owning and carrying handguns for personal
	protection. The authors also make it appear that it is more
	difficult to get a handgun legally in Canada than is actually
	the case.
	
	7. The authors ignore all other factors which might explain
	the differences in crime rate, beyond some vague mention of the
	penalities provided by law and the roughest of estimates of 
	clearence for one particular offense -- homicide involving a
	firearm. There is no measure of: the differences in the number
	of law enforcement officers; their aggressiveness in making
	arrests for gun law violations in the two jurisdictions; arrest
	rates for other offenses; conviction rates; actual sentences
	imposed for gun-related crimes, violent crimes without guns,
	or gun law violations; or incarceration rates. Whereas social
	scientists would attempt to measure and hold for such differences,
	the authors of the NEJM "tale of two cities" fail even to mention
	most factors related to crime control.
	
	8. The authors dismiss claims that handguns are an effective
	means for protection unless the criminal is killed. Such is not
	the case. Criminologists (Ref. 5-8) have found that almost
	650,000 Americans annually use handguns for protection from
	criminals, and that using a gun for protection reduces the
	liklihood that a crime -- rape, robbery, assault -- will be
	completed by the criminal and reduces the likelihood of injury
	to the victim. It is interesting, nonetheless, that the authors
	reported the same number (four) of civilian justifiable homicides
	without firearms in each city but that less restrictive Seattle
	accounted for 100% of the reported civilian justifiable homicides
	involving firearms.
	
	9. The Centers for Disease Control, which funded the "study,"
	editorially praised the paper, (Ref. 9) saying it "applied
	scientific methods to examine a focus of contention betweeb
	advocates of stricter regulation of firearms, particularly
	handguns." There is nothing in the paper which could possibly
	be mistaken for "scientific methods" by a sociologists or
	criminologists. The Vancouver-Seattle "study" is the equivolent
	of testing an experimental drug to control hypertension by finding
	two ordinary-looking middle-class white males, one aged 25
	and the other 40, and without first taking their vital signs,
	administering the experimental drug to the 25-year-old while
	giving the 40-year-old a placebo, then taking their blood pressure
	and, on finding the younger man had a lower blood pressure, 
	announcing in a "special article" a new medical breakthrough.
	It would be nice to think that such a "study" would neither be
	funded by the CDC or printed by the NEJM.
	
	Since the longstanding anti-gun biases of the NEJM and the CDC
	make them willing to present shoddy research as "scientific
	breakthroughs" in "special articles" and editorials relating
	to firearms, we are obligated to correct the record by notifying
	the news media and those with congressional and executive oversight
	over the activities of the Centers for Disease Control about
	the distortions contained in "Handgun Regulations, Crime, Assaults,
	and Homicides: A Tale of Two Cities" and "Firearm Injuries: A Call
	for Science." Clearly, all scientific standards go by the wayside
	whenever the CDC and the New England Journal of Medicine seize
	an opportunity to attack firearms ownership in America.

                             GUNS AND SPUTTER
                            by James D. Wright
          (from July 1989 issue of REASON, Free Minds & Free Markets)

      Someone once wrote: "Statistics are like a bikini.  What they real is
   suggestive, but what they conceal is vital."  The problem is demonstrated
   by the most recent entry in a long line of scientific research purporting
   to show a causal link between gun availability and homicide.  Funded by
   the federal government and published last year in the New England Journal
   of Medicine, the study compared homicide rates in Seattle and Vancouver and
   suggested that a handgun ban "may reduce the rate of homicide in a 
   community."
      The nine medical doctors who published "Handgun Regulations, Crime,
   Assaults, and Homicide" essentially reasoned in three steps: (1) Despite
   many historical, social, and demographic similarities, (2) Vancouver
   has a markedly lower homicide rate (3) because its stricter gun regulations
   make guns less available.  The second step in their reasoning seems
   indisputable.  The overall homicide rate in Seattle (for the period
   1980-86) was 11.3 per 100,000 popuation, compared with 6.9 in Vancouver.
   Homicide is definitely more common in Seattle.  The question then becomes,
   Why?
      The authors present a believable although not entirely accurate case
   to support the notion, as claimed in the third step of their reasoning,
   that Vancouver's handgun regulations are much more stringent.  But their
   evidence on the difference in gun *availabilty* is indirect and 
   unpersuasive; indeed, they acknowledge that direct evidence on the point
   does not exist.  They offer two fragments of inferential data in support
   of the claim that guns are more available in Seattle; but for all anybody
   knows as a matter of empirical fact, the opposite could be true.  We
   are therefore being asked, at the conclusion of the study, to believe that
   a difference in gun availability explains the difference in homicide rates
   when a difference in gun availability has not itself been established.
      Indeed, the situation is even more troublesome.  The first of the two
   indirect bits of evidence is a difference between the number of concealed-
   weapons permits issued in Seattle and the number of restricted-weapons
   permits issued in Vancouver.  Differences between the two cities in the
   permit regulations render these two numbers strictly noncomparable.
*     The second bit of evidence is "Cook's gun prevalence index," which stands
*  at 41 percent for Seattle but only 12 percent for Vancouver.  Cook's index
*  however, does not measure the relative prevalence of gun ownership in 
*  various cities.  It measures gun misuse--it is an average of the percentage
*  of homicides and suicides involving firearms.
*     In the present case, the index shows only that in homicides and suicides,
*  firearms are more likely to be used in Seatte than in Vancouver.  To take
*  Cook's index as a measure of general firearms availability, it must be
*  assumed that the proportional involvement of guns in homicides and suicides
*  is directly related to their relative availability in the general 
*  population.  But this is exactly what the authors are seeking to prove. To
*  assume what one is seeking to prove, then to "prove" it on the basis of
*  that assumption does ot constitute scientific evidence for anything.
      Even if we were to grant, on the basis of no compelling evidence, that
   guns are less common in Vancouver, we might still question what causes what.
   The authors attribute Seattle's higher crime rate to a higher rate of gun
   ownership.  But it might well be argued that low crime or homicide rates
   reduce the motivation for average citizens to obtain guns--in other words,
   that crime rates explain the variation in gun ownership, not vice versa.
      In fact, it was once commonly argued that Great Britain's low rate of
   violent crime was a function of that nation's strict gun laws and the 
   consequent low rate of gun ownership--until British researcher Colin 
   Greenwood found that Great Britain had enjoyed low rates of violent crime
   for many decades before strict firearms controls were enacted.  To invoke
   an ancient methodological saw, correlation is not cause.
      Nor do the problems with this study end with its lack of direct data
   on gun ownership.  The authors say Seattle and Vancouver are "similar in
   many ways," implying that they differ mainly in gun availability, gun-law
   stringency, and crime rates.  This is an evident attempt to establish
   the ceteris paribus condition of a sound scientific analysis--that "all
   else is equal" among things being compared.
*     Clearly the two cities are similar in some ways, but a closer look 
*  reveals differences in ways that are relevant to their respective crime
*  or homicide rates.  The cities are closely matched in what percentage
*  of their population is white (79 percent and 76 percent).  But Seattle
*  is about 10 percent black, while Vancouver is less than 0.5 percent.
*  Vancouver's minority population is overwhelmingly Asian.  So although the
*  authors show that th two cities are approximately comparable on a half-
*  dozen readily available demographic indicators, they have not shown
*  that all potentially relevant sources of variation have been ruled out.
*     In fact, the differences in racial compositions of the two cities is
*  particularly relevant in light of the study's breakdown of homicide rates
*  according to the race of the victim.  For the white majority, the homicide
*  rates are nearly identical--6.2 per 100,000 in Seattle, 6.4 in Vancouver.
*  The differing overall homicide rates in the two cities are therefore due
*  entirely to vastly different rates among racial minorities.  For blacks,
*  the observed difference in homicide rate is 36.6 to 9.5 and for Hispanics
*  26.9 to 7.9.  (Methodoligical complexities render the Asian comparison
*  problematic, but it too is higher in Seattle than in Vancouver.)  Racial
*  minorities are much more likely to be the victims of homicide in Seattle
*  than in Vancouver; the white majority is equally likely to be slain
*  in either city.
      Since the nearly 2:1 initial difference in homicide reates between the
   cities is due exclusively to 3:1 or 4:1 differences between minority 
   groups, it is fair to ask why postulated difference in "gun availability"
   (or gun-law strigency) would matter so dramatically to minorities but not
   matter at all to whites.  Can differential gun availability explain why
   blacks and Hispanics--but not whites--are so much more likely to be killed
   in Seattle than in Vancouver?  (Studies in the United States, incidentally,
   do not show large or consistent racial differences in gun ownership.)
      Or are other explanations more plausible?  Could the disparity between
   Canadian and American rates of poverty among racial minorities have 
   anything to do with it?  What are the relative rates of drug or alcohol 
   abuse?  Of homelessness among each cty's minority population?  (The city
   of Seattle runs the largest shelter for homeless men west of the 
   Mississippi.)  Unemployment among young, central-city, nonwhite men in the
   United States usually exceeds 40 percent.  What is the comparable Canadian
   percentage?
      The crucial point is that Canada and the United States differ in many
   ways, as do cities and population subgroups with the two countries.  Absent
   more detailed analysis, nearly any of these "many ways" might explain part
   or all of the difference in homicide rates.  In gross comparisons such
   as those between Seattle and Vancouver, all else is *not* equal.
*     The authors of this study acknowledge that racial patterns in homicide
*  result in a "complex picture."  They do not acknowledge that the ensuing
*  complexities seriously undercut the main thrust of their argument.  They
*  also acknowledge that "socio-economic status is probably an important
*  confounding factor in our comparison," remarking further that "blacks   
*  in Vancouver had a slightly higher mean income in 1981 than the rest of
*  Vancouver's population."  Given the evidence presented in the article,
*  it is possible that all of the difference in homicide rates between Seattle
*  and Vancouver results from greater proverty among Seattle's racial
*  minorities.  But the authors pay no further attention to this possibility,
*  since "detailed information about household incomes according to race
*  is not available for Vancouver."
      The largely insurmountable methodological difficulties confronted in 
   gross comparative studies of this sort can be illustrated with as simple
   example.  If one were to take all U.S. couties and compare them in terms
   of (1) pervalence of gun ownership and (2) crime or homicide rates, one 
   would find an astonishing pattern: Counties with more guns have less crime.
   Would one conclude from this evidence alone that guns actually reduce 
   crime?  Or would one insist that other variables also be taken into
   account?  In this example, the "hidden variable" is city size: Guns are
   more common in small towns and rural areas, whereas crime is a big-city
   problem.  If researchers failed to anticipate this variable, or lacked the
   appropriate data to examine its possible consequences, they coud be very
   seriously misled.  In the study at hand, the authors matched two cities
   for size but not for minority poverty rates or other hidden variables,
   and their results are impossible to interpret.
      In the editorial "Firearm Injuries: A Call for Science" accompanying
   the study, two officials from the Centers for Disease Control lauded the
   authors for applying "scientific methods" to a problem of grave public
   heath significance.  But in attempting to draw causal conclusions from
   nonexperimental research, the essence of scientific method is to anticipate
   plausible alternative explanations for the results and try to rule them
   out.  Absent such effort, the results may well seem scientific but are
   little more than polemics masquerading as serious research.  That this
   study is but one of a number of recent efforts--all employing practical
   identical research designs and published in leading scientific journals--
   is cause for further concern.

As a "favorite", sure.  As lethal, not likely.  A study of violence in
Chicago produced this table:

		Percentage of Reported Gun and Knife Attacks
			    Resulting in Death
			    
	Weapon				Deaths As Percentage of Attacks
	---------------------------------------------------------------
	Knives (16,518 total attacks)		 2.4
	Guns (6,350 total attacks)		12.2

	Source: Firearms and Violence in American Life
	
It might be contended that if gun murderers were deprived of guns
that they would find a way to kill as often with knives.  If this were
so, knife attacks in cities where guns were widely used in homicide
would be expected to show a low fatality rate, and knife attacks in
cities where guns were not so widely used (like Vancouver) would show
a higher fatality rate.  But the Nat'l Commission on the Causes and
Prevention of Violence Task Force analyzed the data and found this
not to be the case.  It appeared to them that as the number of knife
attacks increased in relation to the number of firearms attacks
(which presumably happened where guns were less available to assailants),
the proportion of FATAL knife attacks did NOT increase relative to the
proportion of gun attacks.  In fact, the reverse was true.

What was found was that most homicides did not show a determination on
the part of the assailant to kill.  Fatalities caused by knife tended
to show a single-mindedness on the part of the assailant to do grave
physical injury: multiple stabs wounds, wounds concentrated about the
head neck and chest, etc.  Most gun homicides did not show this
pattern.  Rather, more fatal attacks were committed during a moment of
rage and not the focused intent to kill the victim.

There are a lot of factors which make a difference.  Actually, I'm not
fond of making ANY kind of social parallels between Europeans and
Americans. There are more cultural, beahvioral and economic
differences between us than similarities.  I just sort of found
myself backed into that corner over the last couple of weeks.  I
don't think we could ever attain the low levels of European violent
crime here in the US, whether we banned guns or required every
law-abiding citizen to carry a loaded Uzi.

On the other hand, we can draw lessons from neighbors who are more
culturally similar, namely the Canadians.  In fact, an exhaustive,
seven-year study has already been done of the respective crime rates
of Vancouver, British Columbia and Seattle, Washington... cities
with roughly the same population, urban economy, geography
and crime but with decidedly different approaches to gun control.

In Seattle, handguns may be purchased legally for self-defense.  After
a 30-day waiting period, a permit can be obtained to carry a concealed
weapon.  The recreational use of handguns is minimally restricted.

In Vancouver, self-defense is not considered a valid or legal reason
to purchase a handgun.  Concealed weapons are not permitted.
Recreational uses of handguns (target shooting, collecting) are
regulated by the province.  Purchase of a handgun requires a
restricted-weapons permit.  A permit to carry may be obtained in
order to transport the weapon to licensed shooting clubs.  Handguns
transported by vehicle must be stored in the trunk in a locked box.
In short, gun control but not unreasonably so.

Both cities aggressively enforce their gun laws.  Convictions for
gun-related offenses carry similar penalties.  The researchers
studied all cases of robbery, assault (simple and aggravated),
burglary and homicides occurring in Seattle and Vancouver from
1/1/80 to 12/31/86. In defining the cases, they used the same
standard: the FBI's Unified Crime Report.

Results: during the seven-year study the annual rate of robbery in
Seattle was found to be only slightly higher than that in Vancouver
(1.09 / 1.11).  Burglaries occurred at nearly identical rates (.99).
18,925 assaults were recorded in Seattle versus 12,034 in
Vancouver.  The risk of being a victim of a simple assault in
Seattle was found to be only slightly higher than Vancouver (1.18 /
1.15) and the risk of aggravated assault was also slightly higher
(1.16 / 1.12).  However, when aggravated assaults were subdivided by
weapon and the mechanism of assault, a clear pattern emerged.
Although both cities reported nearly identical rates of aggravated
assault involving knives and other dangerous weapons, firearms were
far more likely to be used in Seattle.  In fact, 7.7 times as often.

Over the seven-year study, 388 homicides occurred in Seattle
(11.3 per 100,000) vs. 204 homicides in Vancouver (6.9 per 100,000).
After adjustment for differences in age and sex among the populations,
the relative risk of being a victim of homicide in Seattle, as
compared to Vancouver, was found to be 1.63.

When homicides were subdivided by the mechanism of death, the rate
of homicide by knives and other weapons (excluding firearms) in
Seattle was found to be almost identical to that in Vancouver.
Virtually ALL of the increased risk of death in Seattle was due to
a more than fivefold higher rate of homicide by firearms.  Handguns
accounted for roughly 85% of homicides involving firearms.  Handguns
were 4.8 times more likely to be used in homicides in Seattle than
in Vancouver.

The authors of the report also investigated "legally justifiable"
homicides (self-defense).  Only 32 such homicides occurred during
the seven-year study, 11 of which were committed by police.  Only
21 cases of civilians acting in self-defense occurrred: 17 in
Seattle and 4 in Vancouver.  Only 13 involved firearms.  After
excluding these cases, there was virtually no impact on these
earlier findings.

-------

This is, I feel, a very fair report.  One might even make the
argument that it is biased against Canada as a whole because
Vancouver reports annual rates of homicide two to three times
that of Ottawa, Calgary and Toronto while Seattle reports
annual homicide rates only half to two-thirds that of NYC,
Chicago, Los Angeles and Houston.

Critics of handgun control always argue that limited legal access
to handguns will have little effect on the rates of homicide because
persons intent on killing others will only try harder to acquire a
gun or will kill by other means.  This report shows differently.
If the rate of homicide in a community were influenced more by
the strength of intent than by the availability of weapons, we
could expect the rate of homicides by weapons other than guns to
be higher in Vancouver than in Seattle.  However, during the study
interval, Vancouver's rate of homicide by weapons other than guns
was not significantly higher than that in Seattle, suggesting that
few would-be assailants switched to homicide by other methods.

As well, ready access to handguns for self-defense by law-abiding
citizens was not endorsed in this report.  Although Seattle did
experience a higher rate of firearm death for self-defense, these
cases accounted for less than 4% of the homicides in both cities
during the course of the study period.  And, as was reported,
Seattle apparently didn't enjoy relief from any crime category
over Vancouver because citizens may legally arm themselves for
self-defense.

The ATF agent interviewed on "Street Stories" reported that the raid was
ill planned, and went ahead even when they (the BD's) knew the ATF was 
coming. WHY?

I believe this raid was ill planned because they only had 2 days to plan it,
and it was continued when failure was obvious because it had a bit part
in the much larger political agenda of President Clinton. I would even 
suggest that the loss of 4 ATF agents is inconsequential in this the
context of his political agenda. It MIGHT even be beneficial to his agenda, 
as it helps point up just how evil these assualt weapons are. Further proof
might be that the ATF denied their agents (Street Stories report) requests
for sufficient fire power. 

Important dates: 
Feb 25th - NJ assembly votes to overturn assault weapon ban.
Feb 28th - Compound in Waco attacked.	   

On Feb. 25th the New Jersey assembly voted to overturn the assault weapon
ban in that state. It looked like it might be a tight vote, but the Senate
in N.J. was going to vote to overturn the ban. It would not sit well to have
an Eastern state overturn an assault weapon ban, given Clintons stated
agenda on gun control. I suspect Clinton gave the order to get someone or some
group with assualt weapons and have the press present (they were initially
at the incident in Waco) to record the event for the TV audience. The agent 
on "Street Stories" reported that a supervisor was urging them all to "get 
ready fast", as "they know we are coming". I believe this attack continued, 
even tho the probablility of failure was high,  because it came from the top 
down. After the N.J. assembly vote, the ATF had a limited amount of time to
come up with something, and the Wackos in Waco fit the bill nicely.

Say, you bought your Saturn at $13k, with a dealer profit of $2k.
If the dealer profit is $1000, then you would only be paying $12k for
the same car.  So isn't that saving money?

Moreover, if Saturn really does reduce the dealer profit margin by $1000, 
then their cars will be even better deals.  Say, if the price of a Saturn was
already $1000 below market average for the class of cars, then after they
reduce the dealer profit, it would be $2000 below market average.  It will:

1) Attract even more people to buy Saturns because it would SAVE THEM MONEY.
 
2) Force the competitors to lower their prices to survive.

Now, not only will Saturn owners benefit from a lower dealer profit, even 
the buyers for other cars will pay less.

Isn't that saving money?

sure sounds like they got a ringer.  the 325is i drove was definitely

0-60 in 7.4, 1/4 mile in 15.9.  it quotes Car and Driver's figures
of 6.9 and 15.3.  oh, BTW, these numbers are for the 325i.

i don't know how the addition of variable valve timing for 1993 affects it.
but don't take my word for it.  go drive it.

That my be, but every Volvo I've ever owned has lasted far longer than most
other cars.....
1981 Volvo 245....125,000 Miles, still on the road.
1983 Volvo 242....195,000 Miles, still on the road.
1984 Volvo 244....175,000 Miles, still on the road.
And I'll admit, the dealer repair cost is high. But with some mechanical
aptitude of your own, and finding a good indi mechanic, you can avoid most
breakdowns, and make the rest cheap(The sum total of the repairs on the car with
195,000 miles has been 2 mufflers and a radiator. Whoa. Bad repair record). 
And all of these cars are driven fairly hard. None of them are at the head of
a line of cars going 30 MPH....the first two spend a lot of their operating
life with the speedometer pegged...and the only reason the 84 doesn't is it has
a 120 MPH speedo...
What I want to know is....have all you people who hate Volvos been traumatized
by someone in a 745 Turbo wagon blowing you away on the road, or what?

I need a device (either an ISA board or a subsystem) which will
take two RGB video signals and combine them according to a template.
The template can be as simple as a rectangular window with signal
one being used for the interior and signal two for the exterior.
But I beleive fancier harware may also exist which I do not want
to exclude from my search.  I know this sort of hardware exists
for NTSC, etc. but I need it for RGB.

Please email and or post any leads....

Apple has patented their implementation of regions, which presumably
includes the internal data structure (which has never been officially
documented by Apple).  Apple cannot patent the concept of a region.

I'm guessing that either NuTek reverse-engineered Apple's internal data
structure for regions (I dunno if this would hold up in court), or they
came up with their own data structure.  If it's the latter, then they
won't be able to draw PICT files containing regions.  Besides PICT files,
there aren't many places where regions are stored on disk.  (QuickTime
movies, perhaps?)  As long as the region isn't being stored on disk and
transferred from a Mac to a NuTek clone (or vice versa), it doesn't
matter if NuTek uses a completely different internal data structure.

I remember reading that Apple also has a patent on their ADB hardware,
and that the NuTek clones would therefore be lacking an ADB port.  What
other patents does Apple have on the Mac?

Hi. I am looking into buying a Floptical Drive, and was wondering what  
experience people have with the drives from Iomega, PLI, MASS MicroSystems,  
or Procom. These seem to be the main drives on the market. Any advice?

Also, I heard about some article in MacWorld (Sep '92, I think) about  
Flopticals. Could someone post a summary, if they have it?

Thanks in advance. (Reply by post or email, whichever you prefer.)

I Have Version 3.5.1 which I believe was needed for a 040 machine.
You should be able to get the newest version by calling their tech
support at 1-800-456-5522 or if you have a modem you can get the
driver from their BBS at 801-778-4400.

My wife has one of these.  I have not had much chance to fiddle with
it, but in comparison to our Laserwriters with Canon engines, she
complains that the print is too light for her taste.  The difference
is quite apparent even when the print setting on the Select 310 is
adjusted to the darkest possible level.  I don't find it
objectionable, and indeed rather like it, but be warned that some
people don't care for it and it is considerably different. 

I recall that years ago there were lots of debates over write-black
vs. write-white engines when dealing with TeX drivers.  Is something
like that going on here?

Close. My mother comes from Gainesville Tex, right across the border.
They claim to be the chigger capitol of the world, and I believe them.
When I grew up in Fort Worth it was bad enough, but in Gainesville
in the summer an attack was guaranteed.

of professional campaign manuals.  Everything from strategy and
targeting to opposition research, fundraising, and field operations.

Price:           $150 if purchased by May 1, 1993

Shoot out in Salt Lake!  PLEDGE versus Committee for a Libertarian
Majority.  Will the party's membership and platform definitions change? 
Is compromise possible?  The Platform and Bylaws committees are
responsible for making recommendations to the convention concerning
changes in those documents.  At this convention, the party will only
consider deletions to the platform.  The Convention Rules would have to
be amended by a 2/3 vote to change this rule.

The meetings are open to the public.  There is no charge for attending.

I have a 42 yr old male friend, misdiagnosed as having
 osteopporosis for two years, who recently found out that his
 illness is the rare Gaucher's disease. 

Gaucher's disease symptoms include: brittle bones (he lost 9 
 inches off his hieght); enlarged liver and spleen; internal
 bleeding; and fatigue (all the time). The problem (in Type 1) is
 attributed to a genetic mutation where there is a lack of the
 enzyme glucocerebroside in macrophages so the cells swell up.
 This will eventually cause death.

Enyzme replacement therapy has been successfully developed and
 approved by the FDA in the last few years so that those patients
 administered with this drug (called Ceredase) report a remarkable
 improvement in their condition. Ceredase, which is manufactured
 by biotech biggy company--Genzyme--costs the patient $380,000
 per year. Gaucher's disease has justifyably been called "the most
 expensive disease in the world".

NEED INFO:
I have researched Gaucher's disease at the library but am relying
 on netlanders to provide me with any additional information:
**news, stories, reports
**people you know with this disease
**ideas, articles about Genzyme Corp, how to get a hold of
   enough money to buy some, programs available to help with
   costs.
**Basically ANY HELP YOU CAN OFFER

Thanks so very much!

I sometimes see OTC preparations for muscle aches/back aches that
combine aspirin with a diuretic. The idea seems to be to reduce
inflammation by getting rid of fluid. Does this actually work?

They aren't designed, they evolved.  And, much as it discomforts us, in
humans a trouble-free birth process was sacrificed to increased brain and
cranial size.  Wild animals have a much easier time with birth than humans do.
Domestic horses and cows typically have a worse time.  To give you an idea:
my family tree is complicated because a few of my pioneer great-great-
grandfathers had several wives, and we never could figure out which wife
had each child.  One might ask why this happened.  My great-great-
grandfathers were, by the time they reached their forties, quite prosperous
farmers.  Nonetheless, they lost several wives each to the rigors of
childbirth; the graveyards in Spencer, Indiana, and Boswell, North Dakota,
contain quite a few gravestones like "Ida, wf. of Jacob Liptrap, and
baby, May 6, 1853."

>You wanted

More like one in ten.  And the consequences can be devastating; I have
direct experience of more than a dozen victims of a fouled-up breech birth.

>and now you want
>all babies born in hospital based on a guess of how likely maternal
>hemorrhage is and a false belief that it is fatal.

It isn't always fatal.  But it is often fatal, when it happens out of
reach of adequate help.  More often, it permanently damages one's health.

Clearly women's bodies _evolved_ to give birth (I am no believer in divine
design); however, evolution did not favor trouble-free births for humans.

My, aren't we wroth!  I haven't read a more outrageous straw man attack
in months!  I can practically see your mouth foam.

We're statistically sophisticated enough to balance the risks.  Although
I can't produce exact statistics 5 years after the last time we looked
them up, rest assured that we balanced C-section risks against other risks.
I wouldn't encourage my wife to have a Caesarean unless it was clearly
indicated; on the other hand, I am opposed (on obvious grounds) to waiting
until an emergency to give in.

And bear this in mind: my wife took the lead in all of these decisions.
We talked things over, and I did a lot of the leg work, but the main
decisions were really hers.

I don't know of very many home birth advocates, even, that think that
a first-time mother should have her baby at home.

>I'm no Luddite. I've had a section. I'm planning a hospital birth

But people should bother to find out the relative risks.  My wife was
unwilling to take any significant risks in order to have nice surroundings.
In view of the intensity of the birth experience, I doubt surroundings
have much importance anyway.  Somehow the values you're advocating seem
all lopsided to me: taking risks, even if fairly small, of serious
permanent harm in order to preserve something that is, after all,
an esthetic consideration.

DIs it possible to track down "zuma" and determine who/what/where "seradr" is?
If not, why not? I assu\me his/her/its identity is not shielded by policies

I dunno, Warren.  Just the other day I heard a rumor that "Serdar Argic"
(aka Hasan Mutlu and Ahmed Cosar and ZUMABOT) is not really a Turk at all,
but in fact is an Armenian who is attempting to make any discussion of the

Hi...

I'm new to this group, and maybe this has been covered already,
but does anybody out there see the current emphasis on the
environment being turned (unintentionally, of course) into
pantheism?

I've debated this quite a bit, and while I think a legitimate
concern for the planet is a great thing, I can easily see it
being perverted into something dangerous.

As evidence, may I quote THE WALL STREET JOURNAL (of all
things!), April 2 (Editorial page):
"We suspect that's because one party to the (environmental)
dispute thinks the Earth is sanctified.  It's clear that much
of the environmentalist energy is derived from what has been
called the Religious Left, a SECULAR, or even PAGAN fanaticism
that now WORSHIPS such GODS as nature and gender with a
reverence formerly accorded real religions."  (EMPHASIS MINE).

Thoughts?  Reactions?  Harangues?

the classic references in this area are Jacques Ellul for a
liberal/evangelical perspective and Os Guiness for a straight
evangelical view.  If you want to look at non-christian sources
try Alvin Toffler as the perennial optimist.  His views while

This is regardless of technology.  Be careful to separate the issues of
related to speed and dispersion of technology (how far the letter
went and how quickly it got there) and the message being passed in the
technology (something that seems to be totally wrong.)

>How can we help to make best use of computer technology ?

When lecturing in this area I challenge my (non-christan/atheistic) class
about the impact technology has on life, quality of life and the rights
that they consider important.  Depending on how you work out your
faith will determine your response to the use of technology.  For example
friends of mine are considering IVF due to a life threatening situation the
wife is going through; when it is over they will have the baby. (God
willing).  In this case the technology is available and my friends have to
decide what to do.  In all cases though you must decide if the technology
is against God's revealed word.

In the "sex ed" portion of the  high school "health" course I took
in 1984, it was impressed that the only 100% positive way to *not*
get pregnant was to *not* have sex.

Other methods of contraception were discussed, in the framework of
a chart which showed both the _expected_ failure rate (theoretical,
assumes no mistakes) and the _actual_ failure rate (based on research).
Top of the chart was something like this:


 Method                  Expected         Actual 
 ------                 Failure Rate    Failure Rate
 Abstinence                 0%              0% 


And NFP (Natural Family Planning) was on the bottom. The teacher even
said, "I've had some students tell me that they can't use anything for
birth control because they're Catholic. Well, if you're not married and
you're a practicing Catholic, the *top* of the list is your slot, not 
the *bottom*.  Even if you're not religious, the top of the list is
safest."

Yes, this was a public school and after Dr Koop's "failing abstinence,
use a condom" statement on the prevention of AIDS.

HOW TO BECOME AN ASTRONAUT

    First the short form, authored by Henry Spencer, then an official NASA
    announcement.

    Q. How do I become an astronaut?

    A. We will assume you mean a NASA astronaut, since it's probably
    impossible for a non-Russian to get into the cosmonaut corps (paying
    passengers are not professional cosmonauts), and the other nations have
    so few astronauts (and fly even fewer) that you're better off hoping to
    win a lottery. Becoming a shuttle pilot requires lots of fast-jet
    experience, which means a military flying career; forget that unless you
    want to do it anyway. So you want to become a shuttle "mission
    specialist".

    If you aren't a US citizen, become one; that is a must.  After that,
    the crucial thing to remember is that the demand for such jobs vastly
    exceeds the supply.  NASA's problem is not finding qualified people,
    but thinning the lineup down to manageable length.	It is not enough
    to be qualified; you must avoid being *dis*qualified for any reason,
    many of them in principle quite irrelevant to the job.

    Get a Ph.D.  Specialize in something that involves getting your hands
    dirty with equipment, not just paper and pencil.  Forget computer
    programming entirely; it will be done from the ground for the fore-
    seeable future.  Degree(s) in one field plus work experience in
    another seems to be a frequent winner.

    Be in good physical condition, with good eyesight.	(DO NOT get a
    radial keratomy or similar hack to improve your vision; nobody knows
    what sudden pressure changes would do to RKed eyes, and long-term
    effects are poorly understood.  For that matter, avoid any other
    significant medical unknowns.)  If you can pass a jet-pilot physical,
    you should be okay; if you can't, your chances are poor.

    Practise public speaking, and be conservative and conformist in
    appearance and actions; you've got a tough selling job ahead, trying
    to convince a cautious, conservative selection committee that you
    are better than hundreds of other applicants.  (And, also, that you
    will be a credit to NASA after you are hired:  public relations is
    a significant part of the job, and NASA's image is very prim and
    proper.)  The image you want is squeaky-clean workaholic yuppie.
    Remember also that you will need a security clearance at some point,
    and Security considers everybody guilty until proven innocent.
    Keep your nose clean.

    Get a pilot's license and make flying your number one hobby;
    experienced pilots are known to be favored even for non-pilot jobs.

    Work for NASA; of 45 astronauts selected between 1984 and 1988,
    43 were military or NASA employees, and the remaining two were
    a NASA consultant and Mae Jemison (the first black female astronaut).
    If you apply from outside NASA and miss, but they offer you a job
    at NASA, ***TAKE IT***; sometimes in the past this has meant "you
    do look interesting but we want to know you a bit better first".

    Think space:  they want highly motivated people, so lose no chance
    to demonstrate motivation.

    Keep trying.  Many astronauts didn't make it the first time.




    NASA
    National Aeronautics and Space Administration
    Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center
    Houston, Texas

    Announcement for Mission Specialist and Pilot Astronaut Candidates
    ==================================================================

    Astronaut Candidate Program
    ---------------------------

    The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has a need for
    Pilot Astronaut Candidates and Mission Specialist Astronaut Candidates
    to support the Space Shuttle Program. NASA is now accepting on a
    continuous basis and plans to select astronaut candidates as needed.

    Persons from both the civilian sector and the military services will be
    considered.

    All positions are located at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in
    Houston, Texas, and will involved a 1-year training and evaluation
    program.

    Space Shuttle Program Description
    ---------------------------------

    The numerous successful flights of the Space Shuttle have demonstrated
    that operation and experimental investigations in space are becoming
    routine. The Space Shuttle Orbiter is launched into, and maneuvers in
    the Earth orbit performing missions lastling up to 30 days. It then
    returns to earth and is ready for another flight with payloads and
    flight crew.

    The Orbiter performs a variety of orbital missions including deployment
    and retrieval of satellites, service of existing satellites, operation
    of specialized laboratories (astronomy, earth sciences, materials
    processing, manufacturing), and other operations. These missions will
    eventually include the development and servicing of a permanent space
    station. The Orbiter also provides a staging capability for using higher
    orbits than can be achieved by the Orbiter itself. Users of the Space
    Shuttle's capabilities are both domestic and foreign and include
    government agencies and private industries.

    The crew normally consists of five people - the commander, the pilot,
    and three mission specialists. On occasion additional crew members are
    assigned. The commander, pilot, and mission specialists are NASA
    astronauts.

    Pilot Astronaut

    Pilot astronauts server as both Space Shuttle commanders and pilots.
    During flight the commander has onboard responsibility for the vehicle,
    crew, mission success and safety in flight. The pilot assists the
    commander in controlling and operating the vehicle. In addition, the
    pilot may assist in the deployment and retrieval of satellites utilizing
    the remote manipulator system, in extra-vehicular activities, and other
    payload operations.

    Mission Specialist Astronaut

    Mission specialist astronauts, working with the commander and pilot,
    have overall responsibility for the coordination of Shuttle operations
    in the areas of crew activity planning, consumables usage, and
    experiment and payload operations. Mission specialists are required to
    have a detailed knowledge of Shuttle systems, as well as detailed
    knowledge of the operational characteristics, mission requirements and
    objectives, and supporting systems and equipment for each of the
    experiments to be conducted on their assigned missions. Mission
    specialists will perform extra-vehicular activities, payload handling
    using the remote manipulator system, and perform or assist in specific
    experimental operations.

    Astronaut Candidate Program
    ===========================

    Basic Qualification Requirements
    --------------------------------

    Applicants MUST meet the following minimum requirements prior to
    submitting an application.

    4. Height between 64 and 76 inches.

    Citizenship Requirements

    Applications for the Astronaut Candidate Program must be citizens of
    the United States.

    Note on Academic Requirements

    Applicants for the Astronaut Candidate Program must meet the basic
    education requirements for NASA engineering and scientific positions --
    specifically: successful completion of standard professional curriculum
    in an accredited college or university leading to at least a bachelor's
    degree with major study in an appropriate field of engineering,
    biological science, physical science, or mathematics.

      The following degree fields, while related to engineering and the
    sciences, are not considered qualifying:
      - Degrees in technology (Engineering Technology, Aviation Technology,
	Medical Technology, etc.)
      - Degrees in Psychology (except for Clinical Psychology, Physiological
	Psychology, or Experimental Psychology which are qualifying).
      - Degrees in Nursing.
      - Degrees in social sciences (Geography, Anthropology, Archaeology, etc.)
      - Degrees in Aviation, Aviation Management or similar fields.

    Application Procedures
    ----------------------

    Civilian

    The application package may be obtained by writing to:

	NASA Johnson Space Center
	Astronaut Selection Office
	ATTN: AHX
	Houston, TX 77058

    Civilian applications will be accepted on a continuous basis. When NASA
    decides to select additional astronaut candidates, consideration will be
    given only to those applications on hand on the date of decision is
    made. Applications received after that date will be retained and
    considered for the next selection. Applicants will be notified annually
    of the opportunity to update their applications and to indicate
    continued interest in being considered for the program. Those applicants
    who do not update their applications annually will be dropped from
    consideration, and their applications will not be retained. After the
    preliminary screening of applications, additional information may be
    requested for some applicants, and person listed on the application as
    supervisors and references may be contacted.

    Active Duty Military

    Active duty military personnel must submit applications to their
    respective military service and not directly to NASA. Application
    procedures will be disseminated by each service.

    Selection
    ---------

    Personal interviews and thorough medical evaluations will be required
    for both civilian and military applicants under final consideration.
    Once final selections have been made, all applicants who were considered
    will be notified of the outcome of the process.

    Selection rosters established through this process may be used for the
    selection of additional candidates during a one year period following
    their establishment.

    General Program Requirements

    Selected applicants will be designated Astronaut Candidates and will be
    assigned to the Astronaut Office at the Johnson Space Center, Houston,
    Texas. The astronaut candidates will undergo a 1 year training and
    evaluation period during which time they will be assigned technical or
    scientific responsibilities allowing them to contribute substantially to
    ongoing programs. They will also participate in the basic astronaut
    training program which is designed to develop the knowledge and skills
    required for formal mission training upon selection for a flight. Pilot
    astronaut candidates will maintain proficiency in NASA aircraft during
    their candidate period.

    Applicants should be aware that selection as an astronaut candidate does
    not insure selection as an astronaut. Final selection as an astronaut
    will depend on satisfactory completion of the 1 year training and
    evaluation period. Civilian candidates who successfully complete the
    training and evaluation and are selected as astronauts will become
    permanent Federal employees and will be expected to remain with NASA for
    a period of at least five years. Civilian candidates who are not
    selected as astronauts may be placed in other positions within NASA
    depending upon Agency requirements and manpower constraints at that
    time. Successful military candidates will be detailed to NASA for a
    specified tour of duty.

    NASA has an affirmative action program goal of having qualified
    minorities and women among those qualified as astronaut candidates.
    Therefore, qualified minorities and women are encouraged to apply.

    Pay and Benefits
    ----------------

    Civilians

    Salaries for civilian astronaut candidates are based on the Federal
    Governments General Schedule pay scales for grades GS-11 through GS-14,
    and are set in accordance with each individuals academic achievements
    and experience.

    Other benefits include vacation and sick leave, a retirement plan, and
    participation in group health and life insurance plans.

    Military

    Selected military personnel will be detailed to the Johnson Space Center
    but will remain in an active duty status for pay, benefits, leave, and
    other similar military matters.

CONTROVERSIAL QUESTIONS

    These issues periodically come up with much argument and few facts being
    offered. The summaries below attempt to represent the position on which
    much of the net community has settled. Please DON'T bring them up again
    unless there's something truly new to be discussed. The net can't set
    public policy, that's what your representatives are for.


    WHAT HAPPENED TO THE SATURN V PLANS

    Despite a widespread belief to the contrary, the Saturn V blueprints
    have not been lost. They are kept at Marshall Space Flight Center on
    microfilm.

    The problem in re-creating the Saturn V is not finding the drawings, it
    is finding vendors who can supply mid-1960's vintage hardware (like
    guidance system components), and the fact that the launch pads and VAB
    have been converted to Space Shuttle use, so you have no place to launch
    from.

    By the time you redesign to accommodate available hardware and re-modify
    the launch pads, you may as well have started from scratch with a clean
    sheet design.


    WHY DATA FROM SPACE MISSIONS ISN'T IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE

    Investigators associated with NASA missions are allowed exclusive access
    for one year after the data is obtained in order to give them an
    opportunity to analyze the data and publish results without being
    "scooped" by people uninvolved in the mission. However, NASA frequently
    releases examples (in non-digital form, e.g. photos) to the public early
    in a mission.


    RISKS OF NUCLEAR (RTG) POWER SOURCES FOR SPACE PROBES

    There has been extensive discussion on this topic sparked by attempts to
    block the Galileo and Ulysses launches on grounds of the plutonium
    thermal sources being dangerous. Numerous studies claim that even in
    worst-case scenarios (shuttle explosion during launch, or accidental
    reentry at interplanetary velocities), the risks are extremely small.
    Two interesting data points are (1) The May 1968 loss of two SNAP 19B2
    RTGs, which landed intact in the Pacific Ocean after a Nimbus B weather
    satellite failed to reach orbit. The fuel was recovered after 5 months
    with no release of plutonium. (2) In April 1970, the Apollo 13 lunar
    module reentered the atmosphere and its SNAP 27 RTG heat source, which
    was jettisoned, fell intact into the 20,000 feet deep Tonga Trench in
    the Pacific Ocean. The corrosion resistant materials of the RTG are
    expected to prevent release of the fuel for a period of time equal to 10
    half-lives of the Pu-238 fuel or about 870 years [DOE 1980].

    To make your own informed judgement, some references you may wish to

    IMPACT OF THE SPACE SHUTTLE ON THE OZONE LAYER

    From time to time, claims are made that chemicals released from
    the Space Shuttle's Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs) are responsible
    for a significant amount of damage to the ozone layer. Studies
    indicate that they in reality have only a minute impact, both in
    absolute terms and relative to other chemical sources. The
    remainder of this item is a response from the author of the quoted
    study, Charles Jackman.

    The atmospheric modelling study of the space shuttle effects on the
    stratosphere involved three independent theoretical groups, and was
    organized by Dr. Michael Prather, NASA/Goddard Institute for Space
    Studies.  The three groups involved Michael Prather and Maria Garcia
    (NASA/GISS), Charlie Jackman and Anne Douglass (NASA/Goddard Space
    Flight Center), and Malcolm Ko and Dak Sze (Atmospheric and
    Environmental Research, Inc.).  The effort was to look at the effects
    of the space shuttle and Titan rockets on the stratosphere.

    The following are the estimated sources of stratospheric chlorine:

       Industrial sources:    300,000,000 kilograms/year
	  Natural sources:     75,000,000 kilograms/year
	  Shuttle sources:	  725,000 kilograms/year

    The shuttle source assumes 9 space shuttles and 6 Titan rockets are
    launched yearly. Thus the launches would add less than 0.25% to the
    total stratospheric chlorine sources.

    The effect on ozone is minimal:  global yearly average total ozone would
    be decreased by 0.0065%. This is much less than total ozone variability
    associated with volcanic activity and solar flares.

    The influence of human-made chlorine products on ozone is computed
    by atmospheric model calculations to be a 1% decrease in globally
    averaged ozone between 1980 and 1990. The influence of the space shuttle and
    Titan rockets on the stratosphere is negligible.  The launch
    schedule of the Space Shuttle and Titan rockets would need to be
    increased by over a factor of a hundred in order to have about
    the same effect on ozone as our increases in industrial halocarbons
    do at the present time.

    Theoretical results of this study have been published in _The Space
    Shuttle's Impact on the Stratosphere_, MJ Prather, MM Garcia, AR
    Douglass, CH Jackman, M.K.W. Ko and N.D. Sze, Journal of Geophysical
    Research, 95, 18583-18590, 1990.

    HOW LONG CAN A HUMAN LIVE UNPROTECTED IN SPACE

    If you *don't* try to hold your breath, exposure to space for half a
    minute or so is unlikely to produce permanent injury. Holding your
    breath is likely to damage your lungs, something scuba divers have to
    watch out for when ascending, and you'll have eardrum trouble if your
    Eustachian tubes are badly plugged up, but theory predicts -- and animal
    experiments confirm -- that otherwise, exposure to vacuum causes no
    immediate injury. You do not explode. Your blood does not boil. You do
    not freeze. You do not instantly lose consciousness.

    Various minor problems (sunburn, possibly "the bends", certainly some

    HOW THE CHALLENGER ASTRONAUTS DIED

    The Challenger shuttle launch was not destroyed in an explosion. This is
    a well-documented fact; see the Rogers Commission report, for example.
    What looked like an explosion was fuel burning after the external tank
    came apart. The forces on the crew cabin were not sufficient to kill the
    astronauts, never mind destroy their bodies, according to the Kerwin
    team's medical/forensic report.

    The astronauts were killed when the more-or-less intact cabin hit the
    water at circa 200MPH, and their bodies then spent several weeks
    underwater. Their remains were recovered, and after the Kerwin team
    examined them, they were sent off to be buried.


    USING THE SHUTTLE BEYOND LOW EARTH ORBIT

    You can't use the shuttle orbiter for missions beyond low Earth orbit
    because it can't get there. It is big and heavy and does not carry
    enough fuel, even if you fill part of the cargo bay with tanks.

    Furthermore, it is not particularly sensible to do so, because much of
    that weight is things like wings, which are totally useless except in
    the immediate vicinity of the Earth. The shuttle orbiter is highly
    specialized for travel between Earth's surface and low orbit. Taking it
    higher is enormously costly and wasteful. A much better approach would
    be to use shuttle subsystems to build a specialized high-orbit
    spacecraft.

    [Yet another concise answer by Henry Spencer.]


    THE "FACE ON MARS"

    There really is a big rock on Mars that looks remarkably like a humanoid
    face. It appears in two different frames of Viking Orbiter imagery:
    35A72 (much more facelike in appearance, and the one more often
    published, with the Sun 10 degrees above western horizon) and 70A13
    (with the Sun 27 degrees from the west).

    Science writer Richard Hoagland has championed the idea that the Face is
    artificial, intended to resemble a human, and erected by an
    extraterrestrial civilization. Most other analysts concede that the
    resemblance is most likely accidental. Other Viking images show a
    smiley-faced crater and a lava flow resembling Kermit the Frog elsewhere
    on Mars. There exists a Mars Anomalies Research Society (sorry, don't
    know the address) to study the Face.

    The Mars Observer mission will carry an extremely high-resolution
    camera, and better images of the formation will hopefully settle this
    question in a few years. In the meantime, speculation about the Face is
    best carried on in the altnet group alt.alien.visitors, not sci.space or
    sci.astro.

"I hold that space cannot be curved, for the simple reason that it can have
no properties."
"Of properties we can only speak when dealing with matter filling the
space. To say that in the presence of large bodies space becomes curved,
is equivalent to stating that something can act upon nothing. I,
for one, refuse to subscribe to such a view." - Nikola Tesla

CONSTANTS AND EQUATIONS FOR CALCULATIONS

    This list was originally compiled by Dale Greer. Additions would be
    appreciated.

    Numbers in parentheses are approximations that will serve for most
    blue-skying purposes.

    Unix systems provide the 'units' program, useful in converting
    between different systems (metric/English, etc.)

    NUMBERS

	7726 m/s	 (8000)  -- Earth orbital velocity at 300 km altitude
	3075 m/s	 (3000)  -- Earth orbital velocity at 35786 km (geosync)
	6371 km		 (6400)  -- Mean radius of Earth
	6378 km		 (6400)  -- Equatorial radius of Earth
	1738 km		 (1700)  -- Mean radius of Moon
	5.974e24 kg	 (6e24)  -- Mass of Earth
	7.348e22 kg	 (7e22)  -- Mass of Moon
	1.989e30 kg	 (2e30)  -- Mass of Sun
	3.986e14 m^3/s^2 (4e14)  -- Gravitational constant times mass of Earth
	4.903e12 m^3/s^2 (5e12)  -- Gravitational constant times mass of Moon
	1.327e20 m^3/s^2 (13e19) -- Gravitational constant times mass of Sun
	384401 km	 ( 4e5)  -- Mean Earth-Moon distance
	1.496e11 m	 (15e10) -- Mean Earth-Sun distance (Astronomical Unit)

	1 megaton (MT) TNT = about 4.2e15 J or the energy equivalent of
	about .05 kg (50 gm) of matter. Ref: J.R Williams, "The Energy Level
	of Things", Air Force Special Weapons Center (ARDC), Kirtland Air
	Force Base, New Mexico, 1963. Also see "The Effects of Nuclear
	Weapons", compiled by S. Glasstone and P.J. Dolan, published by the
	US Department of Defense (obtain from the GPO).

    EQUATIONS

	Where d is distance, v is velocity, a is acceleration, t is time.
	Additional more specialized equations are available from:

	    ames.arc.nasa.gov:pub/SPACE/FAQ/MoreEquations


	For constant acceleration
	    d = d0 + vt + .5at^2
	    v = v0 + at
	  v^2 = 2ad

	Acceleration on a cylinder (space colony, etc.) of radius r and
	    rotation period t:

	    a = 4 pi**2 r / t^2

	For circular Keplerian orbits where:
	    Vc	 = velocity of a circular orbit
	    Vesc = escape velocity
	    M	 = Total mass of orbiting and orbited bodies
	    G	 = Gravitational constant (defined below)
	    u	 = G * M (can be measured much more accurately than G or M)
	    K	 = -G * M / 2 / a
	    r	 = radius of orbit (measured from center of mass of system)
	    V	 = orbital velocity
	    P	 = orbital period
	    a	 = semimajor axis of orbit

	    Vc	 = sqrt(M * G / r)
	    Vesc = sqrt(2 * M * G / r) = sqrt(2) * Vc
	    V^2  = u/a
	    P	 = 2 pi/(Sqrt(u/a^3))
	    K	 = 1/2 V**2 - G * M / r (conservation of energy)

	    The period of an eccentric orbit is the same as the period
	       of a circular orbit with the same semi-major axis.

	Change in velocity required for a plane change of angle phi in a
	circular orbit:

	    delta V = 2 sqrt(GM/r) sin (phi/2)

	Energy to put mass m into a circular orbit (ignores rotational
	velocity, which reduces the energy a bit).

	    GMm (1/Re - 1/2Rcirc)
	    Re = radius of the earth
	    Rcirc = radius of the circular orbit.

	Classical rocket equation, where
	    dv	= change in velocity
	    Isp = specific impulse of engine
	    Ve	= exhaust velocity
	    x	= reaction mass
	    m1	= rocket mass excluding reaction mass
	    g	= 9.80665 m / s^2

	    Ve	= Isp * g
	    dv	= Ve * ln((m1 + x) / m1)
		= Ve * ln((final mass) / (initial mass))

	Relativistic rocket equation (constant acceleration)

	    t (unaccelerated) = c/a * sinh(a*t/c)
	    d = c**2/a * (cosh(a*t/c) - 1)
	    v = c * tanh(a*t/c)

	Relativistic rocket with exhaust velocity Ve and mass ratio MR:

	    at/c = Ve/c * ln(MR), or

	    t (unaccelerated) = c/a * sinh(Ve/c * ln(MR))
	    d = c**2/a * (cosh(Ve/C * ln(MR)) - 1)
	    v = c * tanh(Ve/C * ln(MR))

	Converting from parallax to distance:

	    d (in parsecs) = 1 / p (in arc seconds)
	    d (in astronomical units) = 206265 / p

	Miscellaneous
	    f=ma    -- Force is mass times acceleration
	    w=fd    -- Work (energy) is force times distance

	Atmospheric density varies as exp(-mgz/kT) where z is altitude, m is
	molecular weight in kg of air, g is local acceleration of gravity, T
	is temperature, k is Bolztmann's constant. On Earth up to 100 km,

	    d = d0*exp(-z*1.42e-4)

	where d is density, d0 is density at 0km, is approximately true, so

	    d@12km (40000 ft) = d0*.18
	    d@9 km (30000 ft) = d0*.27
	    d@6 km (20000 ft) = d0*.43
	    d@3 km (10000 ft) = d0*.65

		    Atmospheric scale height	Dry lapse rate
		    (in km at emission level)	 (K/km)
		    -------------------------	--------------
	    Earth	    7.5			    9.8
	    Mars	    11			    4.4
	    Venus	    4.9			    10.5
	    Titan	    18			    1.3
	    Jupiter	    19			    2.0
	    Saturn	    37			    0.7
	    Uranus	    24			    0.7
	    Neptune	    21			    0.8
	    Triton	    8			    1

	Titius-Bode Law for approximating planetary distances:

	    R(n) = 0.4 + 0.3 * 2^N Astronomical Units (N = -infinity for
	    Mercury, 0 for Venus, 1 for Earth, etc.)

	    This fits fairly well except for Neptune.

    CONSTANTS

	6.62618e-34 J-s  (7e-34) -- Planck's Constant "h"
	1.054589e-34 J-s (1e-34) -- Planck's Constant / (2 * PI), "h bar"
	1.3807e-23 J/K	(1.4e-23) - Boltzmann's Constant "k"

Black Hole radius (also called Schwarzschild Radius):

	2GM/c^2, where G is Newton's Grav Constant, M is mass of BH,

    Things to add (somebody look them up!)
	Basic rocketry numbers & equations

Implicitly you are assuming that goals scored against Winnipeg with Selanne

Knowledgeable hockey observers the world over would agree that
feeding Selanne so he can score does contribute in a meaningful way to
winning.

I will grant that a star like Mario will draw fans, even if the team sucks. 
But this is short term only; I still do not think the attendance increase 
will last, unless the team is a winning/competitive/improving/butt-kicking
one.  Pittsburgh was still getting better, so people continued to support
them.  If they suddenly dropped to, say, 50 points, you'd have knee surgery
for some of the people jumping off the bandwagon.  

>Also, the following year (88-89) the Pens had 89 points not 87. 

Ok.  My numbers came from the NHL Guide and Record Book.

You can give the credit to Mario since he deserves it.  But my point is that
it wasn't Mario himself, but it was the *expectation* of things to come (i.e.
a winning team) that he created by being the next great hockey superstar. And
before anybody jumps in and says I'm nit-picking and mincing words, go back
and read from where this thread started...

It might help to think about what would go through a fan's mind who suddenly
found an interest in Mario and the Pens.  Was it "gee, Mario Lemieux is
amazing, I'll go watch him play", or was it "gee, now we've got a *kick*
*ass* guy on *our* side, I'll go watch him play".  I think it was the latter.

I don't think this is accurate.  The *tickets* sell, but people don't go to
the games.  I think this thread has already been discussed...season ticket
holders in LA don't always use their tickets.  So in effect, after the Kings
initial success following Gretzky's arrival (68 to 91 points, same source)
and corresponding attendance jump, there has been an effective drop in
attendance even though ticket sales may not have changed much.  

Whether or not the Kings are a 'winner' is debatable.  I claim that since
Gretzky's arrival they have at the very least been competitive...I also claim
that McNall has made a stupid move in trying to reassemble the Oiler
dynasty...but that's another story and included only because I don't like
McNall:-).  Anyway,  McNall did do some heavy marketing around Gretzky, and
that undoubtedly was also responsible for the attendance and merchandising
sales, etc.  But as I said, when the Kings have been in there little
tailspins over the past couple of years there have been empty seats at the
Forum even if the tickets were sold.

>I think in the case of a Lemieux or Gretzky, the player can transcend
>winning as the major drawing power.  

For the short term, IMO.  Although I think that it's inevitable that the team
will improve with a player such as Lemieux or Gretzky, simply because they
make people around them better.

>But winning sure as hell helps.  ;-)

Well, at least we are in full agreement here!

>This does not make Roger's point any more valid, but the Jets aren't

So are you saying Roger has ever had a valid point? <couldn't resist...>

>getting a HUGE jump in productivity, yet they ARE getting a huge
>jump in attendance.  This is due to the emergence of Teemu Selanne.
>They have the 17th best record in hockey, it sure as hell isn't because

Yes, but they are doing no worse than last year.  I think the same type of
reasoning I applied to a new Pittsburgh fan applies to all the extra people
showing up at Winnipeg games.  It's difficult to predict, but do you think
that if the Jets miss the playoffs next season that in the year after they
will maintain their attendance levels?  I seriously doubt it, because in that
case the expectation of an improving team would be gone, with or without
Selanne.

I did provide the example of Rocket Ismail and the Toronto Argonauts of the 
CFL...did you leave it out because you don't know much about the CFL?  If 
that's the case then fair enough, but if it isn't the case then I'm curious
to hear your explanation.

I can only comment on the Kings, but the most obvious candidate for pleasant
surprise is Alex Zhitnik. He came highly touted as a defensive defenseman, but
he's clearly much more than that. Great skater and hard shot (though wish he
were more accurate). In fact, he pretty much allowed the Kings to trade away
that huge defensive liability Paul Coffey. Kelly Hrudey is only the biggest
disappointment if you thought he was any good to begin with. But, at best, he's
only a mediocre goaltender. A better choice would be Tomas Sandstrom, though
not through any fault of his own, but because some thugs in Toronto decided 
to threaten his career in order to avoid conceding a goal. Other than that, the
award goes to Robert Lang, an uninspiring Czech. Robitaille could easily be
MVP, but I'd prefer to give it to Rob Blake who is quietly becoming one of the
league's premier defensemen, and if the Kings manage to hold onto him and the 
rest of our young defense, it could one day mean that we'll let in fewer
goals than Hartford. Honorable mentions to Majestic Marty and Warren Rychel.

I would have chosen Alex Zhitnik for biggest suprise.  They
did expect that he would become a great defenseman, but I don't
think anyone knew that he was going to be this impressive in his 
rookie year.  His speed, skating ability, and puck control is
exceptional -- he is the one to watch on the Kings.

First of all, realize that Tesla invented AC power generators, motors,
transformers, conductors, etc. Technically, *ALL* transformers are Tesla
coils.  In general though when someone refers to a Tesla coil, they mean
an "air core resonant transformer". The TV flyback version Tesla
coil (see the _Encyclopedia_of_Electronic_Circuits_ V3, 106-1 for
diagram) has NOT an air core. It is of a class of circuit called
"Oscillating Shuttle Circuit" (OSC). Generally OSC's are highly
efficient, but this version uses transistors and resistors,
which are very lossy devices. Typically Tesla used active
reactances instead of passive resistors, so that he could achieve
efficiencies of 99.5%, and better. The usual application of an air-core
resonant transformer, or of an OSC, is to produce strong EMI
for wireless broadcasts. How well do you think your computer
screen would work if we removed the HF HV Tesla (flyback) coil
from it? If we were to remove from our homes and industries all
Tesla coils, our lights would go dark, our cars would sputter
and die, our radios would go silent, our industries would grind
to a halt, and we would have to go back to using coal for heat,
gas for lamps, horses for transportation, steam for power, and
telegraph for communication. Is that real world enough for you???????

GET THE MESSAGE! WE WOULD NOT HAVE 1/100 THE CONVIENIENCES WE HAVE
TODAY IF NOT FOR TESLA. GIVE CREDIT WHERE CREDIT IS DUE!

If it had been up to Edison, we'd still be in the 19th century.
(flame me at your own peril. I'm very good at putting edison down).

Refer to patents by JAMES HARRIS ROGERS:
958,829; 1,220,005; 1,322,622; 1,349,103; 1,315,862; 1,349,104;
1,303,729; 1,303,730; 1,316,188

He details methods of underground and underwater wireless communications.
For a review, refer to _Electrical_Experimenter_, March 1919 and June 1919.

Rogers' methods were used extensively during the World War, and was
unclassified after the war. Supposedly, the government rethought this
soon after, and Rogers was convieniently forgotten.

The bottom line is that all antennas that are grounded send HALF of
their signal THRU the ground. The half that travels thru space is
quickly dissapated (by the square of the distance), but that which
travels thru the ground does not disapate at all. Furthermore,
the published data showed that when noise drowned out regular
reception, the underground antennas would recieve virtually noise-free.

IF you find this hard to believe, then refer to the work of the
man who INVENTED wireless: Tesla. Tesla confirmed that Rogers' methods
were correct, while Hertzian wave theory was completely "abberant".

gnuplot, etc. make it easy to plot real valued functions of 2 variables
but I want to plot functions whose values are 2-vectors. I have been 
doing this by plotting arrays of arrows (complete with arrowheads) but
before going further, I thought I would ask whether someone has already
done the work. Any pointers??

thanx in advance

        I recently got a file describing a library of rendering routines 
called SIPP (SImple Polygon Processor).  Could anyone tell me where I can 
FTP the source code and which is the newest version around?
        Also, I've never used Renderman so I was wondering if Renderman 
is like SIPP?  ie. a library of rendering routines which one uses to make 
a program that creates the image...

                                        Thanks,  Joe Tham

>Can someone please tell me where I can ftp DTA or DMORPH?

DMorf (Dave's Morph, I think is what it means) and DTax (Dave's 
TGA Assembler) are available in the MSDOS_UPLOADS directory
on the wuarchive.

They are arjed and bundled with their respective xmemory versions,
dmorfx.exe and dtax.exe, you can also find a version of aaplay.exe
there, with which you can view files you create with dta.exe or
dtax.exe.

I downloaded the whole bunch last week and have been morphing 
away the afternoons since.  The programmes are all a bit buggy and
definitely not-ready-to-spread-to-the-masses, but they are very
well written. 

The interface is frustrating at first, but it gets easy once you
figure out the tricks.

I have noticed that dmorfx will crash horribly if you try to morph
without using the splines option.  Not sure why, since I don't have
the source.  I think it was written for TP 6.0.

If anyone else comes up with any other hints on getting the thing 
to work right, tell me; it took me several hours the first time
just to figure out that if I just used the durned splines then 
it would work...

Hello,
     I am looking to add voice input capability to a user interface I am
developing on an HP730 (UNIX) workstation.  I would greatly appreciate 
information anyone would care to offer about voice input systems that are 
easily accessible from the UNIX environment. 

     The names or adresses of applicable vendors, as well as any 
experiences you have had with specific systems, would be very helpful.

     Please respond via email; I will post a summary if there is 
sufficient interest.


Thanks,
Ken


P.S.  I have found several impressive systems for IBM PC's, but I would 
like to avoid the hassle of purchasing and maintaining a separate PC if 
at all possible.

   A program in the archive keymap00.zip on simtel and mirror sites in the 
msdos/keyboard directory will do this.  It is written in assembler and it 
best if you have a compiler to create a new keyboard map.  It is possible, 
however, to use a binary editor to edit the provided compiled keyboard 
driver if you do not have a compiler.  I used hexed100.zip, also available 
on simtel.  Simply serach for the codes 00 01 02 03 to locate the biginning 
of the "normal" keyboard map.  Then swap the codes for the keys that you 
wish to swap.  See the keyboard directory of simtel for programs that report 
the scancode for each key to you (some bios programs also have this info).
Good luck,

- Pete

You realize, of course, that inevitably some anal retentive moron is
going to come along and wag his fingers and his jowls in outrage that
personal politics are more important than [SMCAP][BOLD][Font:God
999pt.]The Law[smcap][bold][font].

But that's irrelevant to the problem here.  Windows came with my
system, but on 5.25" disks.  I hate using 5.25" disks, so I copied
them over to high density 3.5"'s using xcopy.  It worked fine.  In
fact, for a while I was changing configurations and whatnot so much
that I decided to try putting them on the hard disk.  Not only can you
copy them over with one disk per directory, but if you want to, you
can simply copy them all into one directory.  Makes it a lot nicer
when you're switching printer emulations around.

Norton 6.0 I don't have much experience with, but when a friend's
system crashed, we restored from a backup rather than from the
originals, and it worked fine.  This would imply that arj a -r norton
c:\nu would create a workable backup, and if you did a full install
the first time, you've got the whole thing.

Never played with WP for Windows; I'm not too big of a fan of anything
from Utah.

Good luck....

I need a device (either an ISA board or a subsystem) which will
take two RGB video signals and combine them according to a template.
The template can be as simple as a rectangular window with signal
one being used for the interior and signal two for the exterior.
But I beleive fancier harware may also exist which I do not want
to exclude from my search.  I know this sort of hardware exists
for NTSC, etc. but I need it for RGB.

Please email and or post any leads....

The Constitution is not a contract.  It is a statute.  Please,

HOW NOT TO WRITE A DEED

One case involved the construction of a conveyance to grantees "jointly, as 
tenants in common, with equal rights and interest in said land, and to the 
survivor thereof, in fee simple. . . . To Have and to Hold the same unto the 
said parties hereto, equally, jointly, as tenants in common, with equal rights 
and interest for the period or term of their lives, and to the survivor thereof 
at the death of the other."

The court held that the survivorship provision indicated an intent to create a 
joint tenancy.  Germain v. Delaine, 294 Ala. 443, 318 So.2d 681 (1975).

FOR DISCUSSION PURPOSES ONLY

Which makes it legally unsound.  If I were representing Mr. Teel, 
I'd try a procedural approach if I could find one, or recommend 
he plea-bargain.  He's setting himself up to be in hot water.

Yes, very serious.  I claim that I can substantiate my statement that
Rudman says he doesn't believe Perot was investigating him.  You claim
Perot was investigating him.  If you will state that you were in error
on this point, provided I produce the source, I'll go dig it up.

Now give me one reason why I should go to the trouble if you won't
agree to this?  It is simple enough you know.  But I don't have time
to waste if you'll just blow it off with more of the tripe you usually
post.

ABOUT THIS POSTING
------------------
This is a (still rather rough) listing of likely questions and
information about RIPEM, a program for public key mail encryption.  It
(this FAQ, not RIPEM) was written and will be maintained by Marc
VanHeyningen, <mvanheyn@whale.cs.indiana.edu>.  It will be posted to a
variety of newsgroups on a monthly basis; follow-up discussion specific
to RIPEM is redirected to the group alt.security.ripem.

This month, I have reformatted this posting in an attempt to comply
with the standards for HyperText FAQ formatting to allow easy
manipulation of this document over the World Wide Web.  Let me know
what you think.

DISCLAIMER
----------
Nothing in this FAQ should be considered legal advice, or anything
other than one person's opinion.  If you want real legal advice, talk
to a real lawyer.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
---------------------

1)  What is RIPEM?

 RIPEM is a program which performs Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM) using
 the cryptographic techniques of RSA and DES.  It allows your
 electronic mail to have the properties of authentication (i.e. who
 sent it can be confirmed) and privacy (i.e. nobody can read it except
 the intended recipient.)

 RIPEM was written primarily by Mark Riordan <mrr@scss3.cl.msu.edu>.
 Most of the code is in the public domain, except for the RSA routines,
 which are a library called RSAREF licensed from RSA Data Security Inc.

2)  How can I get RIPEM?

 RIPEM contains the library of cryptographic routines RSAREF, which is
 considered munitions and thus is export-restricted from distribution
 to people who are not citizens or permanent residents of the U.S. or
 Canada.  Therefore, the following request is quoted from the README
 file:

 #Please do not export the cryptographic code in this distribution
 #outside of the USA or Canada.  This is a personal request from me,
 #the author of RIPEM, and a condition of your use of RIPEM.

 Note that RSAREF is not in the public domain, and a license for it is
 included with the distribution.  You should read it before using
 RIPEM.

 The best way to get it is to ask a friend for a copy, since this will
 reduce the load on those sites that do carry it (not to mention the
 humans that run them.)  Naturally this requires that you trust the
 friend.

 RIPEM is available via anonymous FTP to citizens and permanent residents
 in the U.S. from rsa.com; cd to rsaref/ and read the README file for
 info.  Last I looked, this site contains only the source tree, and
 does not contain compiled binaries or the nice Mac version.

 RIPEM, as well as some other crypt stuff, has its "home site" on
 rpub.cl.msu.edu, which is open to non-anonymous FTP for users in the
 U.S. and Canada who are citizens or permanent residents.  To find out
 how to obtain access, ftp there, cd to pub/crypt/, and read the file
 GETTING_ACCESS.  For convenience, binaries for many architectures are
 available here in addition to the full source tree.

3)  Will RIPEM run on my machine?

 Probably.  It has already been ported to MS-DOS and most flavors of
 Unix (SunOS, NeXT, Linux, AIX, ULTRIX, Solaris, etc.)  Ports to
 Macintosh include a standard UNIX-style port and a rather nice
 Mac-like port written by Raymond Lau, author of StuffIt.  More ports
 are expected, and help of users is invited.

4)  Will RIPEM work with my mailer?

 Probably.  How easy and clean the effective interface is will depend
 on the sophistication and modularity of the mailer, though.  The users
 guide, included with the distribution, discusses ways to use RIPEM
 with many popular mailers, including Berkeley, mush, Elm, and MH.
 Code is also included in elisp to allow easy use of RIPEM inside GNU
 Emacs.

 If you make a new interface for RIPEM or create an improvement on one
 in the distribution which you believe is convenient to use, secure,
 and may be useful to others, feel free to post it to alt.security.ripem.

5)  What is RSA?

 RSA is a crypto system which is asymmetric, or public-key.  This means
 that there are two different, related keys: one to encrypt and one to
 decrypt.  Because one cannot (reasonably) be derived from the other,
 you may publish your encryption, or public key widely and keep your
 decryption, or private key to yourself.  Anyone can use your public
 key to encrypt a message, but only you hold the private key needed to
 decrypt it.  (Note that the "message" sent with RSA is normally just
 the DES key to the real message. (See "What is DES?")

 Note that the above only provides for privacy.  For authentication,
 the fingerprint of the message (See "What is a fingerprint, like
 MD5?") is encrypted with the sender's private key.  The recipient can
 use the sender's public key to decrypt it and confirm that the message
 must have come from the sender.

 RSA was named for the three men (Rivest, Shamir and Adleman) who
 invented it.  To find out more about RSA, ftp to rsa.com and look in
 pub/faq/ or look in sci.crypt.

6)  What is DES?

 DES is the Data Encryption Standard, a widely used symmetric, or
 secret-key, crypto system.  Unlike RSA, DES uses the same key to
 encrypt and decrypt messages.  However, DES is much faster than RSA.

 RIPEM uses both DES and RSA; it generates a random key and encrypts
 your mail with DES using that key.  It then encrypts that key with the
 recipient's public RSA key and includes the result in the letter,
 allowing the recipient to recover the DES key.

 DES is sometimes considered weak because it is somewhat old and uses a
 key length considered too short by modern standards.  However, it
 should be reasonably safe against an opponent smaller than a large
 corporation or government agency.  It is not unlikely that future
 RIPEMs will strengthen the symmetric cipher, possibly by using
 multiple encryption with DES.

7)  What is PEM, and how does RIPEM relate?

 PEM is Privacy Enhanced Mail, a system for allowing easy transfer of
 encrypted electronic mail.  It is described in RFCs 1421-1424; these
 documents have been approved and obsolete the old RFCs 1113-1115.

 RIPEM is not really a complete implementation of PEM, because PEM
 specifies certificates for authenticating keys, which RIPEM does not
 handle at this time.  Their addition is planned.

8)  What's this about distributing and authenticating keys?

 For a remote user to be able to send secure mail to you, she must know
 your public key.  For you to be able to confirm that the message
 received came from her, you must know her public key.  It is important
 that this information be accurate; if a "bad guy" convinces her that
 his key is in fact yours, she will send messages which he can read.

 RIPEM allows for three methods of key management: a central server,
 the distributed finger servers, and a flat file.  All three are
 described in the RIPEM users guide which is part of the distribution.
 None of them provide perfect security.

9)  Why do all RIPEM public keys look very similar?

 RIPEM public keys begin with a PKCS identifier describing various
 characteristics about the key, so the first bunch of characters in
 your key may be the same as those of lots of other people's keys.
 This does not mean your keys are similar, but only that they are the
 same class of key, were generated with the same program, are of the
 same length, etc.

10)  What is a fingerprint, like MD5?

 MD5 is a message digest algorithm produced by RSA Data Security Inc.
 It provides a 128-bit fingerprint, or cryptographically secure hash,
 of the plaintext.  It is cryptographically secure because it is not
 possible (in a reasonable amount of computation) to produce a
 different plaintext which produces the same fingerprint.  Thus,
 instead of signing the entire message with the sender's private key,
 only the MD5 of the message needs to be signed for authentication.

 MD5 is sometimes used for other purposes; for example, it is often
 used to map an input of arbitrary length to 128 bits of data, as a
 passphrase interpreter or cookie generator.

 MD5 is described in its entirety (including an implementation in C) in
 RFC 1321.

11)  What is PGP?

 PGP is another cryptographic mail program called Pretty Good Privacy.
 PGP has been around longer than RIPEM, and works somewhat differently.
 PGP is not compatible with RIPEM in any way, though PGP does also use RSA.

 Some major differences between PGP and RIPEM:

 - PGP has more key management features, particularly for users without
   a direct network connection.

 - RIPEM conforms to the PEM RFCs and thus has a greater probability of
   working with other PEM software.  PGP makes no attempt to be compatible
   with anything other than PGP (in fact, PGP 1.0 is not compatible with
   PGP 2.0.)

 - RIPEM uses RSAREF, a library of RSA routines from RSA Data Security
   Inc.  RSAREF comes with a license which allows noncommercial use.
   PGP uses its own implementation of RSA which is not licensed; thus,
   PKP, the firm holding the U.S. patents on the RSA algorithm, claims
   that it is a infringement of that patent to make, use or sell PGP in
   the U.S. or Canada.  In acknowledgement of this, PGP's original
   author, Phil Zimmermann, says in the documentation:

   #In fact, if you live in the USA, and you are not a Federal agency, 
   #you shouldn't actually run PGP on your computer, because Public
   #Key Partners wants to forbid you from running my software.  PGP is
   #contraband.  

 - Both PGP and RIPEM are export-restricted, and cannot be sent outside
   the U.S. and Canada.  However, PGP already exists on many ftp sites
   in Europe and other places.

 Whether you use PGP or RIPEM or whatever, the documentation to PGP is
 recommended reading to anyone interested in such issues.

 Note that the above facts, both regarding patent and export
 restrictions, are somewhat controversial; many people think it
 shouldn't be that way, and some people interpret various documents
 differently.  Unfortunately, discussions of it on the net inevitably
 seem to produce more heat than light, and probably belong in
 misc.legal.computing.  (See:  "DISCLAIMER")

12)  What about RPEM?

 RPEM stands for Rabin Privacy Enhanced Mail.  It was similar to RIPEM,
 but used a public-key cipher invented by Rabin (which is not RSA) in
 an attempt to avoid the patent on RSA.  It was written by Mark
 Riordan, the same author as RIPEM.

 Its distribution was halted when, contrary to the beliefs of many
 (including Rabin), Public Key Partners (PKP) claimed that their patent
 was broad enough to cover any public-key cipher whose strength rested
 in the difficulty of factoring products of large primes, not just RSA.
 This claim is not universally accepted by any means, but was not
 challenged for pragmatic reasons.

 RPEM is not really used anymore.  It is not compatible with RIPEM or PGP.

13)  What is MIME?

 MIME stands for Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions, and is
 described in RFC 1341.  You can find out about it in the newsgroup
 comp.mail.mime.  How PEM should interact with MIME is not yet entirely
 clear; some people use the stopgap solution of having a MIME type
 application/x-ripem in order to send RIPEM messages as MIME ones.  I
 hope some standards will emerge.  Draft Internet documents exist on
 the matter.

14)  I have this simple way to defeat the security of RIPEM...

 You may wish to check the companion post "ripem-attacks" which
 discusses some of the more obvious attacks on RIPEM's security and
 what procedures will minimize the risk.  RIPEM's main "weak area" is
 probably key distribution.

SOME POSSIBLE ATTACKS ON RIPEM
------------------------------

This is a living list of potential weaknesses to keep your eyes open
for when using RIPEM for secure electronic mail.  It does not go into
great detail, and is almost certainly not exhaustive.  Obviously, many
of the weaknesses are weaknesses of cryptographically secured mail in
general, and will pertain to secure mail programs other than RIPEM.
It is maintained by Marc VanHeyningen <mvanheyn@cs.indiana.edu>.  It
is posted monthly to a variety of news groups; followups pertaining
specifically to RIPEM should go to alt.security.ripem.

CRYPTANALYSIS ATTACKS
---------------------

- Breaking RSA would allow an attacker to find out your private key,
  in which case he could read any mail encrypted to you and sign
  messages with your private key.

  RSA is generally believed to be resistant to all standard
  cryptanalytic techniques.  Even a standard key (about 516 bits with
  RIPEM) is long enough to render this impractical, barring a
  huge investment in hardware or a breakthrough in factoring.

- Breaking DES would allow an attacker to read any given message,
  since the message itself is encrypted with DES.  It would not allow
  an attacker to claim to be you.

  DES has only 56 bits in its key, and thus could conceivably be
  compromised by brute force with sufficient hardware, but few agencies
  have such money to devote to simply read one message.  Since each
  message has a different DES key, the work for each message would
  remain high.

KEY MANAGEMENT ATTACKS
----------------------

- Stealing your private key would allow the same benefits as breaking
  RSA.  To safeguard it, it is encrypted with a DES key which is derived
  from a passphrase you type in.  However, if an attacker can get a copy
  of your private keyfile and your passphrase (by snooping network
  packets, tapping lines, or whatever) he could break the whole scheme.

  The main risk is that of transferring either the passphrase or the
  private key file across an untrusted link.  So don't do that.  Run 
  RIPEM on a trusted machine, preferably one sitting right in front of
  you.  Ideally, your own machine in your own home (or maybe office)
  which nobody else has physical access to.

- Fooling you into accepting a bogus public key for someone else could 
  allow an opponent to deceive you into sending secret messages to him
  rather than to the real recipient.  If the enemy can fool your
  intended recipient as well, he could re-encrypt the messages with
  the other bogus public key and pass them along.

  It is important to get the proper public keys of other people.
  The most common mechanism for this is finger; assuming the opponent
  has not compromised routers or daemons or such, finger can be 
  given a fair amount of trust.  The strongest method of key
  authentication is to exchange keys in person; however, this is
  not always practical.  Having other people "vouch for you" by
  signing a statement containing your key is possible, although 
  RIPEM doesn't have features for doing this as automatically as
  PGP.  RIPEM does generate and check MD5 fingerprints of public keys
  in the key files; they may be exchanged via a separate channel for
  authentication.

PLAYBACK ATTACKS
----------------

- Even if an opponent cannot break the cryptography, an opponent could
  still cause difficulties.  For example, suppose you send a message
  with MIC-ONLY (a PEM mode which does not provide disclosure protection)
  to Alice which says "OK, let's do that." Your opponent intercepts
  it, and now resends it to Bob, who now has a message which is
  authenticated as from you telling him to do that.  Of course, he may
  interpret it in an entirely different context.  Or your opponent
  could transmit the same message to the same recipient much later,
  figuring it would be seen differently at a later time.  Or the
  opponent could change the Originator-Name: to himself, register 
  your public key as his, and send a message hoping the recipient
  will send him return mail indicating (perhaps even quoting!) the
  unknown message.

  To defeat playback attacks, the plaintext of each message should 
  include some indication of the sender and recipient, and a unique
  identifier (typically the date).  A good front-end script for RIPEM
  should do this automatically (IMHO).  As a recipient, you should be
  sure that the Originator-Name: header and the sender indicated within
  the plaintext are the same, that you really are a recipient, and that
  the message is not an old one.  Some this also can and should be
  automated.  The author of this FAQ has made a modest attempt at
  automating the process of generating and checking encapsulated
  headers; the programs are included in the standard distribution in
  the utils directory.

LOCAL ATTACKS
-------------

- Clearly, the security of RIPEM cannot be greater than the security of
  the machine where the encryption is performed.  For example, under
  UNIX, a super-user could manage to get at your encrypted mail,
  although it would take some planning and effort to do something like
  replace the RIPEM executable with a Trojan horse or to get a copy of
  the plaintext, depending how it's stored.

  In addition, the link between you and the machine running RIPEM is
  an extension of that.  If you decrypt with RIPEM on a remote machine
  which you are connected to via network (or, worse yet, modem), an
  eavesdropper could see the plaintext (and probably also your
  passphrase.)

  RIPEM should only be executed on systems you trust, obviously.  In
  the extreme case, RIPEM should only be used on your own machine,
  which you have total control over and which nobody else has access
  to, which has only carefully examined software known to be free of
  viruses, and so on.  However, there's a very real trade-off between
  convenience and security here.

  A more moderately cautious user might use RIPEM on a UNIX workstation
  where other people have access (even root access), but increase
  security by keeping private keys and the (statically linked, of
  course) executable on a floppy disk.

  Some people will keep RIPEM on a multi-user system, but when dialing
  in over an insecure line, they will download the message to their
  own system and perform the RIPEM decryption there.  However, the
  security provided by such a mechanism is somewhat illusory; since
  you presumably type your cleartext password to log in, you've just
  given away the store, since the attacker can now log in as you and
  install traps in your account to steal your private key next time
  you use it from a less insecure line.  This will likely remain the
  situation as long as most systems use the rather quaint mechanism of
  cleartext password authentication.

  I find it nice to put a brief statement of how carefully I manage my
  security arrangement in my .plan next to my public key, so that
  potential correspondents can be aware what level of precautions are
  in place.  Some people use two keys, a short one which is not
  carefully managed for ordinary use and a longer one which is treated
  with greater care for critical correspondence.

UNTRUSTED PARTNER ATTACKS
-------------------------

- RIPEM's encryption will ensure that only a person with the private key
  corresponding to the public key used to encrypt the data may read the
  traffic.  However, once someone with that key gets the message, she
  may always make whatever kind of transformations she wishes.  There 
  exist no cryptographic barriers to a recipient, say, taking an
  ENCRYPTED message and converting it to a MIC-ONLY message, signed by
  you and readable by anyone, although RIPEM does not provide this
  functionality.  Indeed, the latest PEM draft I have seen specifically
  states that such transformations should be possible to allow
  forwarding functions to work.
 
  Including the recipients in the plaintext, as mentioned above, will
  make it possible for recipients of a redistributed message to be aware
  of its original nature.  Naturally, the security of the cryptography
  can never be greater than the security of the people using it.

ABOUT THIS POSTING
------------------
This is a listing of likely questions and information about RIPEM, a

I am now running a World Wide Web archive of RIPEM information.  It
does not contain much of anything that isn't available elsewhere, but
it has convenient pointers to the most current version of this FAQ and
some other stuff.  The URL is "http://cs.indiana.edu/ripem/dir.html".

This month's version has a fair amount of new pointers to information
on patents and stuff like that.  I've also reordered a few things to
have a more sensible ordering.  I hope I don't have to edit this again
soon. :-)

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
---------------------

1)  What is RIPEM?

 RIPEM is a (not yet complete, but useful) implementation of Privacy
 Enhanced Mail (PEM).  RIPEM allows your electronic mail to have the
 four security facilities provided by PEM: disclosure protection
 (optional), originator authenticity, message integrity measures, and
 non-repudiation of origin (always).  (See: "What is PEM?")

 RIPEM was written primarily by Mark Riordan <mrr@scss3.cl.msu.edu>.
 Most of the code is in the public domain, except for the RSA routines,
 which are a library called RSAREF licensed from RSA Data Security Inc.

 The current version of RIPEM is 1.0.5; the current version of the
 Macintosh port of RIPEM is 0.7.

2)  How can I get RIPEM?

 RIPEM uses the library of cryptographic routines RSAREF, which is
 considered munitions and thus is export-restricted from distribution
 to persons who are not citizens or permanent residents in the U.S or
 Canada without an export license.  No such license has been obtained
 (nor would one likely be granted unless the RSA key exchange were
 shortened to 512 bits and the symmetric cipher changed to something
 weaker than DES.  There are some suggestions that this situation may
 change now that Clinton is in office.)  The author requests in the
 README file that this law not be violated:

 #Please do not export the cryptographic code in this distribution
 #outside of the USA or Canada.  This is a personal request from me,
 #the author of RIPEM, and a condition of your use of RIPEM.

 Note that RSAREF is not in the public domain, and a license for it is
 included with the distribution.  You should read it before using
 RIPEM.

 RIPEM is available via anonymous FTP to citizens and permanent
 residents in the U.S. from rsa.com; cd to rsaref/ and read the README
 file for info.  Note that the non-RSAREF portion of RIPEM is not a
 product of RSA Data Security, Incorporated; they merely are helping
 distribute it.

 RIPEM, as well as some other crypt stuff, has its "home site" on
 ripem.msu.edu, which is open to non-anonymous FTP for users in the
 U.S. and Canada who are citizens or permanent residents.  To find out
 how to obtain access, FTP there, cd to pub/crypt/, and read the file
 GETTING_ACCESS.  For convenience, binaries for many architectures are
 available here in addition to the full source tree.

3)  Will RIPEM run on my machine?

 Probably.  It has already been ported to MS-DOS and most flavors of
 Unix (SunOS, NeXT, Linux, AIX, ULTRIX, Solaris, etc.)  Ports to
 Macintosh include a standard UNIX-style port and a rather nice
 Mac-like port written by Raymond Lau, author of StuffIt.  More ports
 are expected, and help of users is invited.

4)  Will RIPEM work with my mailer?

 Probably.  How easy and clean the effective interface is will depend
 on the sophistication and modularity of the mailer, though.  The users
 guide, included with the distribution, discusses ways to use RIPEM
 with many popular mailers, including Berkeley, mush, Elm, and MH.
 Code is also included in elisp to allow easy use of RIPEM inside GNU
 Emacs.

 If you make a new interface for RIPEM or create an improvement on one
 in the distribution which you believe is convenient to use, secure,
 and may be useful to others, feel free to post it to alt.security.ripem.

5)  What is RSA?

 RSA is a crypto system which is asymmetric, or public-key.  This means
 that there are two different, related keys: one to encrypt and one to
 decrypt.  Because one cannot (reasonably) be derived from the other,
 you may publish your encryption, or public, key widely and keep your
 decryption, or private, key to yourself.  Anyone can use your public
 key to encrypt a message, but only you hold the private key needed to
 decrypt it.  Note that the "message" sent with RSA is normally just
 the DES key to the real plaintext. (See "What is DES?")

 Note that the above only provides for disclosure protection.  For
 originator authenticity, message integrity, and non-repudiation of
 origin services to be implemented, the fingerprint of the message
 (See "What is a fingerprint, like MD5?") is encrypted with the
 sender's private key.  The recipient, or a dispute-resolving
 authority, can use the sender's public key to decrypt it and confirm
 that the message must have come from the sender and was not altered.

 RSA was named for the three men (Rivest, Shamir and Adleman) who
 invented it.  To find out lots more about RSA and modern cryptography
 in general, ftp to rsa.com and look in pub/faq/.  Some information
 also may be in sci.crypt.

6)  What is DES?

 DES is the Data Encryption Standard, a widely used symmetric, or
 secret-key, crypto system.  Unlike RSA, DES uses the same key to
 encrypt and decrypt messages.  However, DES is much faster than RSA.

 RIPEM uses both DES and RSA; it generates a random key and encrypts
 your mail with DES using that key.  It then encrypts that key with the
 recipient's public RSA key and includes the result in the letter,
 allowing the recipient to recover the DES key.

 DES is sometimes considered weak because it is somewhat old and uses a
 key length considered too short by modern standards.  However, it
 should be reasonably safe against an opponent smaller than a large
 corporation or government agency.  It is not likely that the PEM
 standard will incorporate support for other symmetric ciphers in the
 near future, because there is a strong feeling that PEM should be
 stable so it can become utilized widely without early problems with
 interoperability.

7)  What is a fingerprint, like MD5?

 MD5 is a message digest algorithm produced by RSA Data Security Inc.
 It provides a 128-bit fingerprint, or cryptographically secure hash,
 of the plaintext.  It is cryptographically secure because it is not
 possible (in a reasonable amount of computation) to produce a
 different plaintext which produces the same fingerprint.  Thus,
 instead of signing the entire message with the sender's private key,
 only the MD5 of the message needs to be signed for authentication.

 MD5s can also be exchanged directly for authentication; for example,
 RIPEM public keys include an MD5 of the public key in the file, so
 parties wishing to confirm their keys are authentic via a separate
 channel merely need exchange MD5s of keys and verify their accuracy.

 MD5 is sometimes used for other purposes; for example, it is often
 used to map an input of arbitrary length to 128 bits of data, as a
 passphrase interpreter or cookie generator.

 MD5 is described in its entirety (including an implementation in C) in
 RFC 1321.

 There have been some recent suggestions that MD5 may not be as strong
 a hash as was originally believed; presumably some other hash
 function will be used if this is accepted as true.

8)  What is PEM?

 PEM is Privacy Enhanced Mail, a standard for allowing transfer of
 encrypted electronic mail generated over a long period of time by a
 working group of experts.  It is described in RFCs 1421-1424; these
 documents have been approved and obsolete the old RFCs 1113-1115.

 RIPEM is not really a complete implementation of PEM, because PEM
 specifies certificates for authenticating keys, which RIPEM does not
 handle at this time.  Their addition is planned.

9)  What's this about distributing and authenticating keys?

 For a remote user to be able to send secure mail to you, she must know
 your public key.  For you to be able to confirm that the message
 received came from her, you must know her public key.  It is important
 that this information be accurate; if a "bad guy" convinces her that
 his key is in fact yours, she will send messages which he can read.

 RIPEM allows for three methods of key management: a central server,
 the distributed finger servers, and a flat file.  All three are
 described in the RIPEM users guide which is part of the distribution.
 None of them provide perfect security.  The PEM standard calls for
 key management by certificates; the addition of this feature to RIPEM
 is planned, but chicken-egg issues still exist.

10)  Isn't it a bad idea to use patented algorithms in standards like PEM?

 This issue has been considered in the standards process.  RFC 1310,
 the specification for Internet standards, has a discussion (section
 6) on what specifications for nondiscriminatory availability must be
 met for a patented method to be included in a standard.  RFC 1421
 addresses this issue with regard to the patents covering public-key
 cryptography.

 This does not, of course, mean that all questions are settled or that
 everyone is in agreement.  An interesting exchange on the use of
 patented algorithms in standards with regard to public-key
 cryptography is in the League for Programming Freedom archive
 (available via FTP: ftp.uu.net:/doc/lpf) in the files bidzos.letter
 and bidzos.response.  (Amusingly, the LPF files on ftp.uu.net are
 compressed with a patented algorithm.)

11)  What about RSADSI/PKP?

 RSA Data Security, Inc. (RSADSI) is a California-based company
 specializing in cryptographic technologies.  Public Key Partners is a
 firm which holds exclusive sub-licensing rights of the following U.S.
 patents and all of their corresponding foreign patents:

      Cryptographic Apparatus and Method
      ("Diffie-Hellman")............................... No. 4,200,770

      Public Key Cryptographic Apparatus
      and Method ("Hellman-Merkle").................... No. 4,218,582

      Cryptographic Communications System and
      Method ("RSA")................................... No. 4,405,829

      Exponential Cryptographic Apparatus
      and Method ("Hellman-Pohlig").................... No. 4,424,414

 PKP claims these four patents cover all known methods of public key
 cryptography.  The two businesses are rather closely related (for
 example, the same person, Jim Bidzos, is president of both of them.)
 PKP has licensed this technology to a considerable number of
 companies (IBM, DEC, Motorola, AT&T, Lotus...) for use in their
 products.  PKP has also threatened and filed lawsuits defending their
 patents.

 RIPEM was originally created with no connection to RSADSI other than
 its use of the RSAREF library, and for no reason other than its
 author's desire to see widespread use of public-key cryptography.
 However, after the ball started rolling, people at RSADSI got
 interested.  RSADSI decided to carry RIPEM on its FTP site, and some
 people there started making their own RIPEM keys and contributing
 code.  RIPEM even won the "Best Application Built on RSAREF in 1992"
 award.

12)  Why do all RIPEM public keys look very similar?

 RIPEM public keys begin with a PKCS (Public-Key Cryptography
 Standards) identifier describing various characteristics about the
 key, so the first bunch of characters in your key may be the same as
 those of lots of other people's keys.  This does not mean your keys
 are similar, but only that they are the same class of key, were
 generated with the same program, are of the same length, etc.

13)  What is PGP?

 PGP is another cryptographic mail program called Pretty Good Privacy.
 PGP has been around longer than RIPEM, and works somewhat differently.
 PGP is not compatible with RIPEM in any way, though PGP does also use RSA.

 A few major differences between PGP and RIPEM:

 - PGP has more key management features, particularly for users without
   a direct network connection.

 - RIPEM conforms to the PEM RFCs and thus has a greater probability
   of working with other PEM software.  PGP makes no attempt to be
   compatible with anything other than itself.

 - RIPEM uses RSAREF, a library of RSA routines from RSADSI which
   comes with a license allowing noncommercial use.  PGP uses its own
   implementation of RSA.  PKP claims that it is a violation of its
   patents to "make, use or sell" PGP in the U.S. or Canada without
   either a license or written permission.  (See: "DISCLAIMER")
   (See: "What about RSADSI/PKP?")  Phil Zimmermann, the author of
   PGP, stopped distributing it after being threatened with legal
   action; he believed that a licensing scheme could be arranged, but
   it hasn't happened and there seems little prospect of it happening
   in the future.  He acknowledges in the PGP User's Guide:

   #In fact, if you live in the USA, and you are not a Federal agency, 
   #you shouldn't actually run PGP on your computer, because Public
   #Key Partners wants to forbid you from running my software.  PGP is
   #contraband.

 - Both PGP and RIPEM are export-restricted, and cannot be sent outside
   the U.S. and Canada without an export license.  However, PGP
   already exists on many ftp sites in Europe and other places.

 Whether you use PGP or RIPEM or whatever, the documentation to PGP is
 recommended reading to anyone interested in such issues.
 Unfortunately, it's not distributed separately from the program,
 which can be difficult to find in the U.S. on FTP sites due to
 liability concerns.

14)  What about RPEM?

 RPEM stands for Rabin Privacy Enhanced Mail.  It was similar to RIPEM,
 but used a public-key cipher invented by Rabin (which is not RSA) in
 an attempt to avoid the patents on public-key systems.  It was
 written by Mark Riordan, who later wrote RIPEM.

 Its distribution was halted when, contrary to the beliefs of many
 (including Rabin), PKP claimed that their patents were broad enough
 to cover the cipher employed.  This claim is not universally
 accepted, but was not challenged for pragmatic reasons.

 RPEM is not really used anymore.  It is not compatible with RIPEM or PGP.

15)  What is MIME?

 MIME stands for Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions, and is
 described in RFC 1341.  You can find out about it in the newsgroup
 comp.mail.mime; a FAQ exists on it.  How PEM should interact with
 MIME is not yet entirely clear; some people use the stopgap solution
 of having a MIME type application/x-ripem in order to send RIPEM
 messages as MIME ones.  I hope some standards will emerge.  Draft
 Internet documents exist on the matter.

16)  What is TIS/PEM?

 Trusted Information Systems is working on a version of Privacy
 Enhanced Mail for general availability.  Last I heard, it was
 rumored to be integrated into an existing mail user agent (MH)
 rather than a stand-alone system, and in beta test.  I don't know
 much more than that.

17)  I have this simple way to defeat the security of RIPEM...

 You may wish to check the companion post "ripem-attacks" which
 discusses some of the more obvious attacks on RIPEM's security and
 what procedures will minimize the risk.  RIPEM's main "weak area" is
 probably key distribution.
